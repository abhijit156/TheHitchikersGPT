 V She watched it coming in from over the Henley direction, with mild curiosity at first, wondering what those lights were. Living as she did, not a million miles from Heathrow, she was used to seeing lights in the sky, not usually so late in the evening, or so low, though, which is why she was mildly curious. When whatever it was began to come closer and closer, her curiosity began to turn to bemusement. Hmm, she thought, which was about as far as she could get with thinking. She was still feeling dopey and jet-lagged, and the messages that one part of her brain was busy sending to another were not necessarily arriving on time or the right way up. She left the kitchen where she had been fixing herself a coffee, and went to open the back door which led out to the garden. She took a deep breath of cool evening air, stepped outside, and looked up. There was something roughly the size of a large camper-van, parked about a hundred feet above her lawn. It was really there, hanging there, almost silent. Something moved deep inside her. Her arms dropped slowly down to her side. She hardly noticed the scalding coffee slopping over her foot. She was hardly breathing, as slowly, inch by inch, foot by foot, the craft came downwards. Its lights were playing softly over the ground, as if probing and feeling it. They played over her. It seemed beyond all hope that she should be given her chance again. Had he found her? Had he come back? The craft dropped down and down, until at last it settled quietly on her lawn. It didn't look exactly like the one she had seen departing all those years ago, she thought, but flashing lights in the night sky are hard to resolve into clear shapes. Silence. Then a click and a hum. Then another click and another hum. Click-hum. Click-hum. The doorway slid open, spilling light towards her across the lawn. She waited, tingling. A figure stood silhouetted in the light. Then another and another. Wide eyes blinked slowly at her. Hands were slowly raised in greeting. "'Macmillan?' a voice said at last, a strange thin voice that managed the syllables with difficulty. "'Tricia Macmillan? Ms. Tricia Macmillan?' "'Yes,' said Tricia, almost soundlessly. "'We have been monitoring you.' "'Monitoring me?' "'Yes.' They looked at her for a while, their large eyes moving up and down her very slowly. "'You look smaller in real life,' one said at last. "'What?' said Tricia. "'Yes. I don't understand,' said Tricia. She hadn't expected any of this, of course, but even for something that she hadn't expected to begin with it wasn't going the way she expected. At last she said, "'Are you—are you from—Zaphod?' This question seemed to cause a little consternation amongst the three figures. They conferred with each other in some skittering language of their own, and then turned back to her. "'We don't think so.' "'Not as far as we know,' said one. "'Where is Zaphod?' said another, looking up into the night sky. "'I—I don't know,' said Tricia helplessly. "'Is it far from here? Which direction? We don't know.' Tricia realised with a sinking heart that they had no idea who she was talking about, or even what she was talking about. And she had no idea what they were talking about. She put her hopes tightly away again, and snapped her brain back into gear. There was no point in being disappointed. She had to wake up to the fact that she had here the journalistic scoop of the century. What should she do? Go back into the house for a video-camera? Wouldn't they just be gone when she got back? She was thoroughly confused as to strategy. Keep them talking, she thought. Figure it out later. "'You've been monitoring me?' "'All of you. Everything on your planet. TV, radio, telecommunications, computers, video-circuitry, warehouses.' "'What?' "'Car parks. Everything. We monitor everything.' Tricia stared at them. "'That must be very boring, isn't it?' she blurted out. "'Yes.' "'So why—' "'Except—' "'Yes, except what?' "'Game shows. We quite like game shows.' There was a terribly long silence as Tricia looked at the aliens, and the aliens looked at her. "'There's something I would just like to get from indoors,' said Tricia very deliberately. "'Tell you what. Would you or one of you like to come inside with me and have a look?' "'Very much,' they all said enthusiastically. All three of them stood slightly awkwardly in her sitting-room, as she hurried around, picking up a video-camera, a thirty-five-millimetre camera, a tape-recorder, every recording medium she could grab hold of. They were all thin, and under domestic lighting conditions a sort of dim purplish-green. "'I really won't be a second, guys,' Tricia said, as she rummaged through some drawers for spare tapes and films. The aliens were looking at the shelves that held her CDs and her old records. One of them nudged one of the others very slightly. "'Look,' he said, "'Elvis!' Tricia stopped and stared at them all over again. "'You like Elvis?' she said. "'Yes,' they said. "'Elvis Presley?' "'Yes.' She shook her head in bewilderment as she tried to stuff a new tape into her video-camera. "'Some of your people,' said one of her visitors hesitantly, "'think that Elvis has been kidnapped by space aliens.' "'What!' said Tricia. "'Has he?' "'It is possible. Are you telling me that you have kidnapped Elvis?" guffs Trisha. She was trying to keep cool enough not to foul up her equipment, but this was all almost too much for her. "'No, not us,' said her guest. "'Aliens. It is a very interesting possibility. We talk of it often.'" "'I must get this down,' Trisha muttered to herself. She checked her video is properly loaded and working now. She pointed the camera at them. She didn't put it up to her eye, because she didn't want to freak them out, but she was sufficiently experienced to be able to shoot accurately from the hip. "'Okay,' she said. "'Now tell me slowly and carefully who you are. You first,' she said to the one on the left. "'What's your name?' "'I don't know.' "'You don't know?' "'No.' "'I see. So, Trisha, what about you other two?' "'We don't know.' "'Good. Okay. Perhaps you can tell me where you're from?' They shook their heads. "'You don't know where you're from?' They shook their heads again. "'So,' said Trisha, "'what are you—' She was floundering, but being a professional kept the camera steady while she did it. "'We are on a mission,' said one of the aliens. "'A mission? A mission to do what?' "'We do not know.' Still she kept the camera steady. "'So what are you doing here on earth, then?' "'We have come to fetch you.' "'Rocksteady. Rocksteady. Could have been on a tripod.' She wondered if she should be using a tripod, in fact. She wondered that because it gave her a moment or two to digest what they had just said. No, she thought, hand-held gave her more flexibility. She also thought, Help! What am I going to do? "'Why?' she asked calmly. "'Have you come to fetch me?' "'Because we have lost our minds.' "'Excuse me,' said Trisha. "'I'm going to have to get a tripod.' They seemed happy enough to stand there doing nothing, while Trisha quickly found a tripod and mounted the camera on it. Her face was completely immobile, but she did not have the faintest idea what was going on and what to think about it. "'Okay,' she said when she was ready. "'We liked your interview with the astrologer.' "'You saw it?' "'We see everything. We are very interested in astrology. We like it. It is very interesting. Not everything is interesting. Astrology is interesting. What the stars tell us, what the stars foretell, we could do with some information like that.' "'But—' Trisha didn't know where to start. Own up, she thought. There's no point in trying to second-guess any of this. So she said, "'But I don't know anything about astrology.' "'We do.' "'You do?' "'Yes. We follow our horoscopes. We are very avid. We see all your newspapers and your magazines and are very avid with them. But our leader says we have a problem.' "'You have a leader?' said Trisha. "'Yes.' "'What's his name?' "'We do not know.' "'What does he say his name is, for Christ's sake? Sorry, I'll need to edit that. What does he say his name is?' "'He does not know.' "'So how do you all know he's the leader? He sees control. He said someone has to do something round here. Ah!' said Trisha, seizing on a clue. "'Where is here?' "'Rupert.' "'What?' "'Your people call it Rupert, the tenth planet from the sun. We have settled there for many years. It is highly cold and uninteresting there, but good for monitoring.' "'Why are you monitoring us?' said Trisha. "'It is all we know to do.' "'Okay,' said Trisha. ''Right. What is the problem that your leader says you have?' "'Triangulation.' "'I beg your pardon?' "'Astrology is a very precise science. We know this.' "'Well,' said Trisha, then left it at that, ''but it is precise for you here on earth.' "'Yes.' "'Yes.' "'She had a horrible feeling she was getting a vague glimmering of something. "'So when Venus is rising in Capricorn, for instance, that is from earth. How does that work if we are out on Rupert? What if the earth is rising in Capricorn? It is hard for us to know. Amongst the things we have forgotten, which we think are many and profound, is trigonometry. "'Let me get this straight,' said Trisha. "'You want me to come with you to Rupert, yes? To recalculate your horoscopes for you to take account of the relative positions of earth and Rupert? Yes. Do I get an exclusive? Yes.' "'I'm your girl,' said Trisha, thinking at the very least she could sell it to the National Enquirer. As she boarded the craft that would take her off to the furthest limits of the solar system, the first thing that met her eyes was a bank of video monitors across which thousands of images were sweeping. A fourth alien was sitting watching them, but was focused on one particular screen that held a steady image. It was a replay of the impromptu interview which Trisha had just conducted with his three colleagues. He looked up when he saw her apprehensively climbing in. "'Good evening, Miss Macmillan,' he said. "'Nice camera work.'
 Chapter 17 For a long period of time there was much speculation and controversy about where the so-called missing matter of the universe had got to. All over the galaxy the science departments of all the major universities were acquiring more and more elaborate equipment to probe and search the hearts of distant galaxies, and then the very centre and the very edges of the whole universe, but when eventually it was tracked down it turned out, in fact, to be all the stuff which the equipment had been packed in. There was quite a large quantity of missing matter in the box, little soft round pellets of missing matter, which Random discarded for future generations of physicists to track down and discover all over again once the findings of the current generation of physicists had been lost and forgotten about. Out of the pellets of missing matter she lifted the featureless black disc. She put it down on a rock beside her and sifted amongst all the missing matter to see if there was anything else, a manual or some attachments or something, but there was nothing else at all, just the black disc. She shone the torch on it. As she did so cracks began to appear along its apparently featureless surface. Random backed away nervously, but then saw that the thing, whatever it was, was merely unfolding itself. The process was wonderfully beautiful. It was extraordinarily elaborate, but also simple and elegant. It was like a piece of self-opening origami, or a rosebud blooming into a rose in just a few seconds. Where, just a few moments earlier, there had been a smoothly curved black disc, there was now a bird, a bird hovering there. Random continued to back away from it carefully and watchfully. It was a little like a picker-bird, only rather smaller. That is to say, in fact, it was larger, or to be more exact, precisely the same size, or at least not less than twice the size. It was also both a lot bluer and a lot pinker than picker-birds, while at the same time being perfectly black. There was also something very odd about it, which Random couldn't immediately make out. It certainly shared with picker-birds the impression it gave that it was watching something that you couldn't see. Suddenly it vanished. Then, just as suddenly, everything went black. Random dropped into a tense crouch, feeling for the specially sharpened rock in her pocket again. Then the blackness receded and rolled itself up into a ball, and then the blackness was the bird again. It hung in the air in front of her, beating its wings slowly and staring at her. "'Excuse me,' it said suddenly. 'I just have to calibrate myself. Can you hear me when I say this?' "'When you say what?' demanded Random. "'Good,' said the bird. "'And can you hear me when I say this?' It spoke this time at a much higher pitch. "'Yes, of course I can,' said Random. "'And can you hear me when I say this?' it said this time in a sepulchrally deep voice. "'Yes!' Then there was a pause. "'No, obviously not,' said the bird, after a few seconds. "'Good. Well, your hearing range is obviously between sixteen and twenty kilohertz.' "'So is this comfortable for you?' it said in a pleasant light tenor. "'No uncomfortable harmonics screeching away in the upper register?' "'Obviously not. Good. I can use those as data channels. Now, how many of me can you see?' Suddenly the air was full of nothing but interlocking birds. Random was well used to spending time in virtual realities, but this was something far weirder than anything she had previously encountered. It was as if the whole geometry of space was redefined in seamless bird shapes. Random gasped and flung her arms around her face, her arms moving through bird-shaped space. "'Hmm, obviously way too many,' said the bird. "'How about now?' It concertinaed into a tunnel of birds, as if it was a bird caught between parallel mirrors, reflecting infinitely into the distance. "'What are you?' shouted Random. "'We'll come to that in a minute,' said the bird. "'Just how many, please?' "'Well, you're sort of—' Random gestured helplessly off into the distance. "'I see. Still infinite in extent, but at least we're homing in on the right dimensional matrix. "'Good. No, the answer is an orange and two lemons.' "'Lemons?' said Random. "'If I have three lemons and three oranges, and I lose two oranges and a lemon, what do I have left?' "'Huh?' "'Okay, so you think that time flows that way, do you? Interesting. "'Am I still infinite?' It asked, ballooning this way and that in space. "'Am I infinite now? How yellow am I?' Moment by moment the bird was going through mind-mangling transformations of shape and extent. "'I can't—' said Random, bewildered. "'You don't have to answer. I can tell from watching you now. "'So am I your mother? Am I a rock? Do I seem huge, squishy, and sinuously intertwined? "'No. How about now? Am I going backwards?' For once the bird was perfectly still and steady. "'No.' said Random. "'Well, I was, in fact, but I was moving backwards in time. "'Hmm. Well, I think we've sorted all that out now. "'If you'd like to know, I can tell you that in your universe, "'you move freely in three dimensions that you call space. "'You move in a straight line in a fourth, which you call time, "'and stay rooted to one place in a fifth, which is the first fundamental of probability. "'After that it gets a bit complicated, "'and there's all sorts of stuff going on in dimensions 13 to 22 "'that you really wouldn't want to know about. "'All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe "'is a lot more complicated than you might think, "'even if you start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated in the first place. "'I can easily not say words like damn if it offends you.' "'Say what you damn well like,' said Random. "'I will.' "'What the hell are you?' demanded Random. "'I am the guide. In your universe I am your guide. "'In fact, I inhabit what is technically known "'as the whole sort of general mish-mash, which means... "'Well, let me show you.' It turned in mid-air and swooped out of the cave, and then perched on a rock, just beneath an overhang, out of the rain, which was getting heavier again. "'Come on,' it said. "'Watch this.' Random didn't like being bossed around by a bird, but she followed it to the mouth of the cave anyway, still fingering the rock in her pocket. "'Rain,' said the bird. "'You see, just rain.' "'I know what rain is,' said Random. "'Sheets of the stuff were sweeping through the night, "'moonlight sifting through it.' "'So what is it?' "'What do you mean, what is it? "'Look, who are you? "'What were you doing in that box? "'Why have I spent a night running through the forest "'fending off demented squirrels, "'to find that all I've got at the end is a bird "'asking me what rain is? "'It's just water falling through the bloody air, "'that's what it is. "'Anything else you want to know, or can we go home now?' There was a long pause before the bird answered. "'You want to go home?' "'I haven't got a home!' Random almost shocked herself. She screamed the word so loudly. "'Look into the rain,' said the bird-guide. "'I'm looking into the rain. "'What else is there to look at?' "'What do you see?' "'What do you mean, you stupid bird? "'I see a lot of rain. "'It's just water falling.' "'What shapes do you see in the water?' "'Shapes? "'There aren't any shapes. "'It's just a—' "'Just a mishmash,' said the bird-guide. "'Yes. "'Now what do you see?' "'Just on the very edge of visibility, "'a thin, faint beam fanned out of the bird's eyes. "'In the dry air beneath the overhang, "'there was nothing to see. "'Where the beam hit the drops of water as they fell through it, "'there was a flat sheet of light, "'so bright and vivid it seemed solid.' "'Oh, great! "'A laser show!' said Random fractiously. "'Never seen one of those before, of course, "'except at about five million rock concerts. "'Tell me what you see. "'Just a flat sheet, stupid bird!' "'There's nothing there that wasn't there before. "'I'm just using light to draw your attention "'to certain drops at certain moments. "'Now what do you see?' "'The light shut off. "'Nothing. "'I'm doing exactly the same thing, "'but with ultraviolet light. "'You can't see it.' "'So what's the point of showing me something I can't see?' "'So that you understand that just because you see something "'doesn't mean to say it's there, "'and if you don't see something, "'it doesn't mean to say it's not there. "'It's only what your senses bring to your attention.' "'I'm bored of this!' said Random, and then gasped. "'Hanging in the rain was a giant and very vivid "'three-dimensional image of her father "'looking startled about something. "'About two miles behind Random, "'her father, struggling his way through the woods, "'suddenly stopped. "'He was startled to see an image of himself "'looking startled about something, "'hanging brightly in the rain-filled air "'about two miles away. "'About two miles away, some distance to the right, "'of the direction in which he was heading. "'He was almost completely lost, "'was convinced he was going to die of cold "'and wet and exhaustion, "'and was beginning to wish he could just get on with it. "'He had just been brought an entire golfing magazine "'by a squirrel as well, "'and his brain was beginning to howl and gibber. "'Seeing a huge bright image of himself light up in the sky "'told him that, on balance, "'he was probably right to howl and gibber, "'but probably wrong as far as the direction "'he was heading was concerned. "'Taking a deep breath, "'he turned and headed off "'towards the inexplicable light-show. "'Okay, so what's that supposed to prove?' "'demanded Random. "'It was the fact that the image was her father "'that had startled her, "'rather than the appearance of the image itself. "'She had seen her first hologram when she was two months old "'and had been put in it to play. "'She had seen her most recent one about half an hour ago, "'playing the March of the Androquandtine Star-Guard. "'Only that it's no more there or not there "'than the sheet was,' said the bird. "'It's just the interaction of water from the sky "'moving in one direction, "'with light at frequencies your senses can detect "'moving in another. "'It makes an apparently solid image in your mind, "'but it's all just images in the mish-mash. "'Here's another one for you.' "'My mother!' said Random. "'No,' said the bird. "'I know my mother when I see her!' "'The image was of a woman emerging from a spacecraft "'inside a large grey hangar-like building. "'She was being escorted by a group of tall, thin, "'purplish-green creatures. "'It was definitely Random's mother. "'Well, almost definitely. "'Trillian wouldn't have been walking quite so uncertainly "'in low gravity, or looking round her "'at a boring old life-support environment "'with quite such a disbelieving look on her face, "'or carrying such a quaint old camera.' "'So who is it?' demanded Random. "'She is part of the extent of your mother "'on the probability axis,' said the bird-guide. "'I haven't the faintest idea what you mean,' said Random. "'Space, time, and probability all have axes "'along which it is possible to move. "'Still don't know, though I think—' "'No, no, no. Explain.' "'I thought you wanted to go home,' said the bird. "'Explain!' "'Would you like to see your home?' "'See it! It was destroyed!' "'It is discontinuous along the probability axis. Look!' "'Something very strange and wonderful "'now swam into view in the rain. "'It was a huge, bluish-greenish globe, "'misty and cloud-covered, "'turning with majestic slowness "'against a black, starry background. "'Now you see it,' said the bird. "'Now you don't.' "'A little less than two miles away now, "'Arthur Dent stood still in his tracks. "'He could not believe what he could see, "'hanging there shrouded in rain, "'but brilliant and vividly real "'against the night sky—the earth. "'He gasped at the sight of it. "'Then, at the moment he gasped, "'it disappeared again. "'Then it appeared again. "'Then—and this is the bit that made him "'give up and stick straws in his hair— "'it turned into a sausage.' "'Random was also bewildered "'at the sight of this huge, blue-and-green "'and watery and misty sausage "'hanging above her. "'And now it was a string of sausages, "'or rather it was a string of sausages "'in which many of the sausages were missing. "'The whole brilliant string turned and spanned "'in a bewildering dance in the air, "'and then gradually slowed, "'grew insubstantial, and faded "'into the glistening darkness of the night. "'What was that?' asked Random in a small voice. "'A glimpse along the probability axis "'of a discontinuously probable object.' "'I see,' said Random. "'Most objects mutate and change "'along their axis of probability, "'but the world of your origin "'does something slightly different. "'It lies on what you might call a fault-line "'in the landscape of probability, "'which means that at many probability coordinates "'the whole of it simply ceases to exist. "'It has an inherent instability, "'which is typical of anything "'that lies within what are usually designated "'the plural sectors. "'Make sense?' "'No.' "'Want to go and see for yourself?' "'To earth.' "'Yes,' said the bird. "'Is that possible?' "'The bird-guy did not answer at once. "'It spread its wings, "'and with an easy grace "'ascended into the air, "'and flew out into the rain, "'which once again was beginning to lighten. "'It soared ecstatically up and down "'into the night sky. "'Lights flashed around it. "'Dimensions dithered in its wake. "'It swooped and turned, "'and looped and turned again, "'and came at last to rest two feet "'in front of Random's face, "'its wings beating slowly and silently. "'It spoke to her again. "'Your universe is vast to you, "'vast in time, vast in space. "'That's because of the filters "'through which you perceive it. "'But I was built with no filters at all, "'which means I perceive the mishmash "'which contains all possible universes, "'but which has itself "'no size at all. "'For me, anything is possible. "'I am omniscient and omnipotent, "'extremely vain, "'and what is more, "'I come in a handy self-carrying package. "'You have to work out how much of the above is true.' "'A slow smile spread over Random's face. "'You bloody little thing, "'you've been winding me up. "'As I said, anything is possible. "'As I said, anything is possible.' "'Random laughed. "'Okay,' she said, "'let's try and go to Earth. "'Let's go to Earth at some point on its, uh, "'probability axis? "'Yes, where it hasn't been blown up. "'Okay. So you're the guide. How do we get a lift?' "'Reverse engineering,' said the bird. "'What?' "'Reverse engineering. "'To me the flow of time is irrelevant. "'You decide what you want. "'I then merely make sure "'that you understand. "'You're joking. Anything is possible.' "'Random frowned. "'You are joking, aren't you?' "'Let me put it another way,' said the bird. "'Reverse engineering enables us to "'shortcut all the business of waiting for one of the "'horribly few spaceships that passes through your "'galactic sector every year or so to make up "'its mind about whether or not it feels like giving you a lift. "'You want a lift? A ship arrives and gives you one. "'The pilot may think he has any one of a million reasons "'why he has decided to stop and pick you up. "'The real reason? "'The real reason is that I have determined that he will.' "'This is you being extremely vain, isn't it, little bird?' said Random. The bird was silent. "'Okay,' said Random. "'I want a ship to take me to earth. "'Will this one do?' It was so silent that Random had not noticed the descending spaceship until he was nearly on top of her. Arthur had noticed it. He was a mile away now and closing. Just after the illuminated sausage display had drawn to its conclusion, he had noticed the faint glimmerings of further lights coming down out of the clouds, and had, to begin with, assumed it to be another piece of flashy, sunny lumiere. It took a moment or so for it to dawn on him that it was an actual spaceship, and a moment or two longer for him to realise that it was dropping directly down to where he assumed his daughter to be. That was when, rain or no rain, old leg injury or no leg injury, darkness or no darkness, he suddenly started really to run. He fell almost immediately, slid and hurt his knee quite badly on a rock. He slithered back up to his feet and tried again. He had a horrible cold feeling that he was about to lose Random for ever. Limping and cursing, he ran. He didn't know what it was that had been in the box, but the name on it had been Ford Prefect, and that was the name he called it. He had been in the box for a long time, Ford Prefect, and that was the name he cursed as he ran. The ship was one of the sexiest and most beautiful ones that Random had ever seen. It was astounding, sleek, silver, ineffable. If she didn't know better, she would have said it was an RW-6. As it settled silently beside her, she realised that it actually was an RW-6, and she could scarcely breathe for excitement. An RW-6 was the sort of thing you only saw in the sort of magazines that were designed to provoke civil unrest. She was also extremely nervous. The manner and timing of its arrival was deeply unsettling. Either it was the most bizarre coincidence or something very peculiar and worrying was going on. She waited a little tensely for the ship's hatch to open. Her guide, she thought of it as hers now, was hovering lightly over her right shoulder, its wings barely fluttering. The hatch opened. Just a little dim light escaped. A faint sound of a bell rang. A moment or two passed, and a figure emerged. He stood still for a moment or so, obviously trying to accustom his eyes to the darkness. Then he caught sight of Random standing there, and seemed a little surprised. He started to walk towards her. Then suddenly he shouted in surprise and started to run at her. Random was not a good person to take a run at on a dark night when she was feeling a little strung out. She had unconsciously been fingering a book in her pocket from the moment she saw the craft coming down. Still running, slithering, hurtling and bumping into trees, Arthur saw at last that he was too late. The ship had only been on the ground for about three minutes, and now, silently, gracefully, it was rising up above the trees again, turning smoothly in the fine speckle of rain to which the storm had now abated, climbing, climbing, tipping up its nose, and suddenly, effortlessly hurtling up through the clouds. Gone. Random was in it. It was impossible for Arthur to know this, but he just went ahead and knew it anyway. She was gone. He had had his stint at being a parent and could scarcely believe how badly he had done at it. He tried to continue running, but his feet were dragging, his knee was hurting like fury, and he knew that he was too late. He could not conceive of anything that would make him feel more wretched and awful than this. But he was wrong. He limped his way at last to the cave where Random had sheltered and opened the box. The ground bore the indentations of the spacecraft that had landed there only minutes before, but of Random there was no sign. He wandered disconsolately into the cave, found the empty box and piles of missing matter pellets strewn around the place. He was left to herself. Feeling a bit cross with her about something like that helped him feel less desolate about her leaving. He knew he had no means of finding her. His foot knocked against something unexpected. He bent down to pick it up and was thoroughly surprised to discover what it was. It was his old Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. How did that come to be in the cave? He had never returned to collect it from the scene of the crash. He had not wanted to revisit the crash and he had not wanted the Guide again. He had reckoned he was here on Lamuella making sandwiches for good. How did it come to be in the cave? It was active. The words on the cover flashed Don't Panic at him. He went out of the cave again into the dim and damp moonlight. He sat on a rock to have a look through the old Guide and then discovered it wasn't a rock. It was a person.
 Chapter 16 Arthur wasn't quite certain which he noticed as being missing first. When he noticed that the one wasn't there his mind instantly leapt to the other, and he knew immediately that they were both gone, and that something insanely bad and difficult to deal with would happen as a result. Random was not there, and neither was the parcel. He had left it up on a shelf all day in plain view. It was an exercise in trust. He knew that one of the things he was supposed to do as a parent was to show trust in his child, to build a sense of trust and confidence into the bedrock of the relationship between them. He had had a nasty feeling that that might turn out to be an idiotic thing to do, but he did it anyway, and sure enough it had turned out to be an idiotic thing to do. You live and learn. At any rate, you live. You also panic. Arthur ran out of the hut. It was the middle of the evening, the light was getting dim, and a storm was brewing. He could not see her anywhere, nor any sign of her. He asked. No one had seen her. He asked again. No one else had seen her. They were going home for the night. A little wind was whipping round the edge of the village, picking things up and tossing them around in a dangerously casual manner. He found old Thrashbarg and asked him. Thrashbarg looked at him asternally, and then pointed in the one direction that Arthur had dreaded, and had therefore instinctively known was the way she would have gone. So now he knew the worst. She had gone where she thought he would not follow her. He looked up at the sky, which was sullen, streaked, and livid, and reflected that it was the sort of sky that the four horsemen of the Apocalypse wouldn't feel like a bunch of complete idiots riding out of. With a heavy sense of the utmost foreboding, he set off on the track that led to the forest in the next valley. The first heavy blobs of rain began to hit the ground, as Arthur tried to drag himself to some sort of run. Random reached the crest of the hill, and looked down into the next valley. It had been a longer and harder climb than she had anticipated. She was a little worried that doing the trip at night was not that great an idea, but her father had been mooching around near the hut all day, trying to pretend to either her or himself that he wasn't guarding the parcel. At last he had to go over to the forge to talk with Strinder about the knives, and Random had seized her opportunity and done a runner with the parcel. It was perfectly clear that she couldn't just open the thing there in the hut, or even in the village. He might have come across her at any moment, which meant that she had to go where she wouldn't be followed. She could stop where she was now. She had gone this way in the hope that he wouldn't follow her, and even if he did he would never find her up in the wooded parts of the hill with the night drawing in and the rain starting. All the way up the parcel had been jiggling under her arm. It was a satisfyingly hunky sort of thing, a box with a square top about the length of her forearm on each side, and about the length of her hand deep, wrapped up in brown plasper, with an ingenious new form of self-knotting string. It didn't rattle as she shook it, but she sensed that its weight was concentrated excitingly at the centre. Having come so far, though, there was a certain satisfaction in not stopping here, but carrying on down into what seemed to be almost a forbidden area, where her father's ship had come down. She wasn't exactly certain what the word haunted meant, but it might be fun to find out. She would keep going and save the parcel up when she got there. It was getting darker, though. She hadn't used her tiny electric torch yet, because she didn't want to be visible from a distance. She would have to use it now, but it probably didn't matter now, since she would be on the other side of the hill which divided the valleys from each other. She turned her torch on. Almost at the same time a fork of lightning ripped across the valley into which she was heading, and startled her considerably. As the darkness shuddered back around her, and a clap of thunder rolled out across the land, she felt suddenly rather small and lost, with just a feeble pencil of light bobbing in her hand. Perhaps she would stop after all, and open the parcel here, or maybe she should go back and come out again to-morrow. It was only a momentary hesitation, though. She knew there was no going back to-night, and sensed that there was no going back ever. She headed on down the side of the hill. The rain was beginning to pick up now. Where a short while ago it had been a few heavy blobs, it was settling in for a good pour now, hissing in the trees, and the ground was getting slippery under her feet. At least she thought it was the rain hissing in the trees. Shadows were leaping and leering at her as her light bobbed through the trees, onwards and downwards. She hurried on for another ten or fifteen minutes, soaked to the skin now and shivering, and gradually became aware that there seemed to be some other light somewhere ahead of her. It was very faint, and she wasn't certain if she was imagining it or not. She turned off her torch to see. There did seem to be some sort of dim glow ahead. She couldn't tell what it was. She turned her torch back on, and continued down the hill towards whatever it was. There was something wrong with the woods, though. She couldn't immediately say what it was, but they didn't seem like sprightly, healthy woods looking forward to a good spring. The trees were lolling at sickly angles, and had a sort of pallid, blighted look about them. Random more than once had the worrying sensation that they were trying to reach towards her as she passed them, but it was just a trick of the way that her light caused the shadows to flicker and lurch. Suddenly something fell out of a tree in front of her. She leapt backwards with alarm, dropping both the torch and the box as she did so. She went down into a crouch, pulling the specially sharpened rock out of her pocket. The thing that had fallen out of the tree was moving. The torch was lying on the ground and pointing towards it, and a vast, grotesque shadow was slowly lurching through the light towards her. She could hear faint rustling and screeching noises over the steady hiss of the rain. She scrabbled on the ground for the torch, found it, and shone it directly at the creature. At the same moment another dropped from a tree just a few feet away. She swung the torch wildly from one to another. She held her rock up, ready to throw. They were quite small, in fact. It was the angle of the light that had made them loom so large. Not only small, but small, furry, and cuddly. And there was another dropping from the trees. It fell through the beam of light, so that she saw it quite clearly. It fell neatly and precisely, turned, and then, like the other two, started slowly and purposefully to advance on random. She stayed rooted to the spot. She still had her rock poised and ready to throw, but was increasingly conscious of the fact that the things she had it poised and ready to throw at were squirrels, or at least squirrel-like things. Soft, warm, cuddly, squirrel-like things. Advancing on her in a way she wasn't at all certain she liked. She shone her torch directly on the first of them. It was making aggressive, hectoring, screeching noises, and carrying in one of its little fists a small, tattered piece of wet pink rag. Random hefted her rock menacingly in her hand, but it made no impression at all on the squirrel advancing on her with its wet piece of rag. She backed away. She didn't at all know how to deal with this. If they had been vicious, snarling, slavering beasts with glistening fangs, she would have pitched into them with a will, but squirrels behaving like this she couldn't quite handle. She backed away again. The second squirrel was starting to make a flanking manoeuvre round to her right, carrying a cup, some kind of acorn thing. The third was right behind it and making its own advance. What was it carrying? Some little scrap of soggy paper, Random thought. She stepped back again, caught her ankle against the root of a tree, and fell over backwards. Instantly the first squirrel darted forward and was on top of her, advancing along her stomach with cold purpose in its eyes and a piece of wet rag in its fist. Random tried to jump up, but only managed to jump about an inch. The startled movement of the squirrel on her stomach startled her in return. The squirrel froze, gripping her skin through her soaking shirt with its tiny claws. Then slowly, inch by inch, it made its way up her, stopped, and proffered her the rag. She felt almost hypnotised by the strangeness of the thing and its tiny, glinting eyes. It proffered her the rag again. It pushed it at her repeatedly, screeching insistently, until at last, nervously, hesitantly, she took the thing from it. It continued to watch her intently, its eyes darting all over her face. She had no idea what to do. Rain and mud were streaming down her face, and she had a squirrel sitting on her. She wiped some mud out of her eyes with the rag. The squirrel shrieked triumphantly, grabbed the rag back, leapt off her, ran scampering into the dark and closing night, darted up into a tree, dived into a hole in the trunk, settled back, and lit a cigarette. Meanwhile Random was trying to fend off the squirrel with the acorn-cup full of rain and the one with the paper. She shuffled backwards on her bottom. No! she shouted. Go away! They darted back in fright, and then darted right forward again with their gifts. She brandished her rock at them. Go! she yelled. The squirrel scampered round in consternation. Then one darted straight at her, dropped the acorn-cup in her lap, turned and ran off into the night. The other stood quivering for a moment, then put its scrap of paper neatly down in front of her, and disappeared as well. She was alone again, but trembling with confusion. She got unsteadily to her feet, picked up her rock and her parcel, then paused and picked up the scrap of paper as well. It was so soggy and dilapidated it was hard to make out what it was. It seemed just to be a fragment of an in-flight magazine. Mrs. Random was trying to understand exactly what it was that all this meant. A man walked out into the clearing in which she was standing, raised a vicious-looking gun, and shot her. Arthur was thrashing around hopelessly two or three miles behind her, on the upward side of the hill. Within minutes of setting out he had gone back again and equipped himself with a lamp, not an electric one. The only electric light in the place was the one that Random had brought with her. This was a kind of dim hurricane lamp, a perforated metal canister from Strindor's Forge, which contained a reservoir of inflammable fish oil, a wick of knotted dried grass, and was wrapped in a translucent film made from the dried membranes from the gut of a perfectly normal beast. It had now gone out. Arthur jiggled around with it in a thoroughly pointless kind of a way for a few seconds. There was clearly no way he was going to get the thing suddenly to burst into flame again in the middle of a rainstorm, but it's impossible not to make a token effort. Reluctantly he threw the thing aside. What to do? This was hopeless. He was absolutely sodden, his clothes heavy and billowing with the rain, and now he was lost in the dark as well. For a brief second he was lost in the blinding light, then he was lost in the dark again. The sheet of lightning had at least shown him that he was very close to the brow of the hill. Once he had breasted that he would—well, he wasn't certain what he would do. He'd have to work that out when he got there. He limped forward and upwards. A few minutes later he knew that he was standing panting at the top. There was some kind of dim glow in the distance below him. He had no idea what it was, and indeed he hardly liked to think. It was the only thing he had to make towards, though, so he started to make his way, stumbling, lost and frightened, towards it. A flash of lethal light passed straight through Random, and about two seconds later so did the man who had shot it. Other than that he paid her no attention whatsoever. He had shot someone standing behind her, and when she turned to look he was kneeling over the body and going through its pockets. The tableau froze and vanished. It was replaced a second later by a giant pair of teeth, framed by immense and perfectly glossed red lips. A huge blue brush appeared out of nowhere and started foamily to scrub at the teeth, which continued to hang there, gleaming in the shimmering curtain of rain. Random blinked at it twice before she got it. It was a commercial. The guy who had shot her was part of a holographic in-flight movie. She must now be very close to where the ship had crashed. Obviously some of its systems were more indestructible than others. The next half-mile of the journey was particularly troublesome. Not only did she have the cold and the rain and the night to contend with, but also the fractured and thrashing remains of the ship's on-board entertainment system. Spaceships and jet-cars and helipods crashed and exploded continuously around her, illuminating the night. Villainous people in strange hats smuggled dangerous drugs through her, and the combined orchestra and chorus of the Halopolis State Opera performed the closing march of the Andrew Quantine Star-Guard from Act IV of Rysgar's Blamwellamum of Wound, in a little glade somewhere off to her left. Then she was standing on the lip of a very nasty-looking and bubbly-edged crater. There was still a faint warm glow coming from what would otherwise have looked like an enormous piece of caramelized chewing-gum in the centre of the pit—the melted remains of a great spaceship. She stood looking at it for a longish while, and then at last started to walk along and round the edge of the crater. She was no longer certain what she was looking for, but kept moving anyway, keeping the horror of the pit to her left. The rain was beginning to ease off a little, but it was still extremely wet, and since she didn't know what it was that was in the box—whether it was perhaps something delicate or damageable—she thought she ought to find somewhere reasonably dry to open it. She hoped she hadn't already damaged it by dropping it. She played her torch around the surrounding trees, which were thin on the ground here, and mostly charred and broken. In the middle distance she thought she could see a jumbled outcrop of rock which might provide some shelter, and she started to pick her way towards it. All around she found the detritus that had been ejected from the ship as it broke up, before the final fireball. After she had moved two or three hundred yards from the edge of the crater, she came across the tattered fragments of some fluffy pink material, sodden, muddied, and drooping amongst the broken trees. She guessed correctly that this must be the remains of the escape-cocoon which had saved her father's life. She went and looked at it more closely, and then noticed something else close to it on the ground, half covered in mud. She picked it up and wiped the mud off it. It was some kind of electronic device the size of a small book. Feebly glowing on its cover, in response to her touch, were some large friendly letters. They said, Don't panic. She knew what this was. It was her father's copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. She felt instantly reassured by it, turned her head up to the thundery sky, and let some rain wash over her face and into her mouth. She shook her head and hurried on towards the rocks. Clambering up and over them, she almost immediately found the perfect thing—the mouth of a cave. She played her torch into its interior. It seemed to be dry and safe. Picking her way carefully, she walked in. It was quite spacious, but didn't go that deep. Exhausted and relieved, she sat on a convenient rock, put the box down in front of her, and started immediately to open it.
 It was another eagle, a different eagle. The next one was a different eagle, too, and the next. The air seemed to be thick with eagles, and it was obviously impossible to enter Valhalla without getting swooped on by at least half a dozen of them. Even eagles were being swooped on by eagles. Dirk threw up his arms over his head to fend off the wild beating furies, turned, tripped, and fell down behind a huge table onto a floor of heavy, damp, earthy straw. His hat rolled under the table, he scrambled after it, stuffed it back firmly on his head, and slowly peered up over the table. The hall was dark, but alive with great bonfires. Noise and wood smoke filled the air, and the smells of roasting pigs, roasting sheep, roasting boar, and sweat, and reeking wine, and singed eagle wings. The table he was crouched behind was one of countless slabs of oak on trestles that stretched in every direction, laden with steaming hunks of dead animals, huge breads, great iron beakers slopping with wine, and candles like wax anthills. There were a multitude of sweaty figures seethed around them, on them, eating, drinking, fighting over the food, fighting in the food, fighting with the food. A yard or so from Dirk a warrior was standing on top of a table fighting a pig which had been roasting for six hours, and he was clearly losing, but losing with vim and spirit, and being cheered on by other warriors who were dousing him down with wine from a trough. The roof, as much of it as could be made out at this distance, and by the dark and flickering light of the bonfires, was made of lashed-together shields. Dirk clutched his hat, kept his head down, and ran, trying to make his way towards the side of the hall. As he ran, feeling himself to be virtually invisible by reason of being completely sober, and by his own lights normally dressed, he seemed to pass examples of every form of bodily function imaginable, other than actual teeth-cleaning. The smell, like that of the tramp in King's Cross Station, who must surely be here participating, was one that never stopped coming at you. It grew and grew until it seemed that your head had to become bigger and bigger to accommodate it. The din of sword on sword, sword on shield, sword on flesh, flesh on flesh, was one that made the eardrums reel and quiver and want to cry. He was pummeled, tripped, elbowed, shoved, and drenched with wine as he scurried and pushed through the wild throng, but arrived at last at a side wall, massive slabs of wood and stone, faced with sheets of stinking cowhide. Panting, he stopped for a moment, looked back, and surveyed the scene with amazement. It was Valhalla. Of that there could be absolutely no question. This was not something that could be mocked up by a catering company, and the whole seething wild mass of carousing gods and warriors and their caroused athletes, with their shields and fires and boars, did seem to fill a space that must be something approaching the size of St. Pancras Station. The sheer heat that rose off it all seemed as if it should suffocate the flocks of deranged eagles which thrashed through the air above them. And maybe it was. He was by no means certain that a flock of enraged eagles which thought they might be suffocating would behave significantly differently from many of the eagles he was currently watching. There was something he had been putting off wondering while he had fought his way through the mass, but the time had come to wonder it now. What, he wondered, about the Dracots? What could the Dracots possibly be doing here? And where in such a melee could the Dracots possibly be? He narrowed his eyes and peered into the heaving throng, trying to see if he could locate anywhere a pair of red designer spectacles or a quiet Italian suit, mingling out there with the clanging breastplates and the sweaty leathers, knowing that the attempt was futile, but feeling that it should be made. No, he decided he couldn't see them. Not, he felt, any kind of party. Further reflections along these lines were cut short by a heavy short-handled axe which hurtled through the air and buried itself in an astounding thud in the wall about three inches from his left ear, and for a moment blotted out all thought. When he recovered from the shock of it and let his breath out, he thought that it was probably not something that had been thrown at him with malicious intent, but was merely warriorly high spirits. Nevertheless, he was not in a partying mood, and decided to move on. He edged his way along the wall in the direction which, had this actually been St. Pancras Station rather than the Hall of Valhalla, would have led to the ticket office. He didn't know what he would find there, but he reckoned that it must be different to this, which would be good. It seemed to him that things were generally quieter here, out on the periphery. The biggest and best of the good times seemed to be concentrated more strongly towards the middle of the hall, whereas the tables he was passing now seemed to be peopled with those who looked as if they had reached that season in their immortal lives when they preferred to contemplate the times when they used to wrestle dead pigs, or to pass appreciative comments to each other about the finer points of dead-pig-wrestling technique, than actually to wrestle with one again themselves just at the moment. He overheard one remark to his companion that it was the left-handed, three-fingered flat grip on the opponent's sternum that was all-important at the crucial moment of finally not quite falling over in a complete stupor, to which his companion responded with a benign, Oah! Dirk stopped, looked, and backtracked. Sitting hunched in a thoughtful posture over his iron plate, and clad in heavily stained and matted furs and buckles which were, if anything, more rank and stinking than the ensemble Dirk had last encountered him in, was Dirk's companion from the concourse at King's Cross Station. Dirk wondered how to approach him. A quick back-slap and a, hey, good party, lots of energy, was one strategy, but Dirk didn't think it was the right one. While he was wondering, an eagle suddenly swooped down from out of the air, and with a lot of beating and thrashing, landed on the table in front of the old man, folded its wings, and advanced on him, demanding to be fed. Easily the old man pulled a bit of meat off a bone, and held it up to the great bird, which pecked it sharply but accurately out of his fingers. Dirk thought that this was the key to a friendly approach. He leant over the table and picked up a small hunk of meat, and offered it in turn to the bird. The bird attacked him and went for his neck, forcing him to try and beat the savage creature off with his hat, but the introduction was made. Oah! said the man, chewed the eagle away, and shifted a couple of inches along the bench. Though it was not a fulsome invitation, it was at least an invitation. Dirk clambered over the bench and sat down. Thank you, said Dirk, puffing. Oah! If you remember, we— At that moment the most tremendous reverberating thump sounded out across Valhalla. It was the sound of a drum being beaten, but it sounded like a drum of immense proportions, as it had to be to make itself heard over the tumult of noise with which the hall was filled. The drum sounded three times in slow and massive beats, like the heartbeat of the hall itself. Dirk looked up to see where the sound might have come from. He noticed for the first time that at the south end of the hall to which he had been heading a great balcony or bridge extended across most of its width. There were some figures up there, dimly visible through the heat haze and the eagles, but Dirk had a sense that whoever was up there presided over whoever was down here. Odin, thought Dirk. Odin, the All-Father, must be up on the balcony. The sound of the revels died down quickly, though it was several seconds before the reverberations of the noise finally fell away. When all was quiet but expectant, a great voice rang out from the balcony and through the hall. The voice said, The time of the challenging hour is nearly at an end. The challenging hour has been called by the great god Thor, for the third time of asking where is Thor? A murmuring throughout the hall suggested that nobody knew where Thor was, and why he had not come to make his challenge. The voice said, This is a very grave affront to the dignity of the All-Father. If there is no challenge before the expiration of the hour, the penalty for Thor must be correspondingly grave. The drum beat again three times, and the consternation in the hall increased. Where was Thor? He is with some girl, said a voice above the rest, and there were loud shouts of laughter, and a return to the hubbub of before. Yes, said Dirk quietly, I expect he probably is. Oah! Dirk had supposed that he was talking to himself, and was surprised to have elicited a response from the man, though not particularly surprised at the response that had been elicited. Thor called this meeting to-night, Dirk asked him. Oah! Bit rude not to turn up. Oah! I expect everyone's a bit upset. Not as long as there's enough pigs to go round. Pigs! Oah! Dirk didn't immediately know how to go on from here. Oah! he said resignedly. It's only Thorus really cares, you see, said the old man. Keeps on issuing his challenge, then not being able to prove it. Can't argue. Gets all confused and angry, does something wrong, can't sort it out, and gets made to do a penance. Everybody else just turns up for the pigs. Oah! Dirk was learning a whole new conversational technique, and was astounded at how successful it was. He regarded the man with a newfound respect. Do you know how many stones there are in Wales? asked the old man suddenly. Oah! said Dirk warily. He didn't know this joke. Nor do I. He wouldn't tell anybody. Says count them yourself, and goes off in a sulk. Oah! I think it was a very good one. So this time he hasn't even turned up. Can't say I blame him. But I'm sorry, because I think he might be right. Oah! The man lapsed into silence. Dirk waited. Oah! he said again hopefully. Nothing. Uh, so, uh, said Dirk, going for a cautious prompt. You think he might be right, eh? Oah! So old Thor might be right, eh? That's the story, said Dirk. Oah! Uh, in what way, said Dirk, running out of patience at last, do you think he might be right? Oh, every way. Oah! said Dirk, defeated. It's no secret that the gods have fallen on hard times, said the old man grimly. That's clear for all to see, even for the ones who only care about the pigs, which is most of them. And when you feel you're not needed any more, it can be hard to think beyond the next pig, even if you used to have the whole world there with you. Everyone just accepts it as inevitable—everyone except Thor, that is. And now he's given up—hasn't even bothered to turn up and break a pig with us. Given up his challenge. Oah! Oah! said Dirk. Oah! So, uh, Thor's challenge, then, said Dirk tentatively. Oah! What was it? Oah! Dirk lost his patience entirely and rounded on the man. What was Thor's challenge to Odin, he insisted angrily. The man looked round at him in slow surprise, looked him up and down with his big, sagging eyes. You're a mortal, aren't you? Yes, said Dirk testily. I'm a mortal. Of course I'm a mortal. What has being a mortal got to do with it? How did you get here? I followed you. He pulled the screwed-up empty cigarette packet out of his pocket and put it on the table. Thanks, he said. I owe you. It was a pretty feeble type of apology, he thought, but it was the best he could manage. Oah! the man looked away. What was Thor's challenge to Odin? said Dirk, trying hard to keep the impatience out of his voice this time. What does it matter to you? the old immortal said bitterly. You're a mortal. Why should you care? You've got what you want out of it, you and your kind. For what little it's now worth. Got what we want out of what? The deal, said the old immortal. The contract that Thor claims Odin has entered into. Contract? said Dirk. What contract? The man's face filled with an expression of slow anger. The bonfires of Valhalla danced deeply in his eyes as he looked at Dirk. The sale, he said darkly, of an immortal soul. What? said Dirk. He had already considered this idea and discounted it. You mean a man has sold his soul to him? What man? It doesn't make sense. No, said the man. That wouldn't make sense at all. I said an immortal soul. Thor says that Odin has sold his soul to man. Dirk stared at him with horror, and then slowly raised his eyes to the balcony. Something was happening there. The great drum beat out again, and the hall of Valhalla began to hush itself once more. But a second or third drumbeat failed to come. Something unexpected seemed to have occurred, and the figures on the balcony were moving in some confusion. The challenging hour was just expiring, but a challenge of some kind seemed to have arrived. Dirk beat his palms to his forehead and swayed where he sat as all kinds of realizations finally dawned on him. Not to man, he said, but to a man and a woman, a lawyer and an advertiser. I said it was all her fault the moment I saw her. I didn't realize I might actually be right. He rounded on his companion urgently. I have to get up there, he said. For God's sake, help me.
 Chapter 9 Arthur felt at a bit of a loss. There was a whole galaxy of stuff out there for him, and he wondered if it was churlish of him to complain to himself that it lacked just two things—the world he was born on and the woman he loved. Damn it and blast it, he thought, and felt the need of some guidance and advice. He consulted the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He looked up Guidance, and it said, See under Advice. He looked up Advice, and it said, See under Guidance. They had been doing a lot of that kind of stuff recently, and he wondered if it was all it was cracked up to be. He headed to the outer eastern rim of the galaxy, where it was said wisdom and truth were to be found, most particularly on the planet Hawalius, which was a planet of oracles and seers and soothsayers and also takeaway pizza shops, because most mystics were completely incapable of cooking for themselves. However, it appeared that some sort of calamity had befallen this planet. As Arthur wandered the streets of the village where the major prophets lived, it had something of a crestfallen air. He came across one prophet who was clearly shutting up shop in a despondent kind of way, and asked him what was happening. "'No call for us any more,' he said, gruffly, as he started to bang a nail into the plank he was holding across the window of his hovel. "'Oh, why's that?' "'Hold on to the other end of this, and I'll show you.' Arthur held up the unnailed end of the plank, and the old prophet scuttled into the recesses of his hovel, returning a moment or two later with the small sub-ether radio. He turned it on, fiddled with the dial for a moment, and put the thing on the small wooden bench that he usually sat and prophesied on. He then took hold of the plank again, and resumed hammering. Arthur sat and listened to the radio. "'Be confirmed,' said the radio. "'Tomorrow,' it continued, the Vice-President of Pothlavigas, Rupi Ghastip, will announce that he intends to run for President, in a speech he will give tomorrow at— "'Find another channel,' said the prophet. Arthur pushed the preset button. "'Refused to comment,' said the radio. "'Next week's jobless totals in the Zarbush sector,' it continued, "'will be the worst since records began. A report published next month says—' "'Find another,' barked the prophet crossly. Arthur pushed the button again. "'Denied it categorically,' said the radio. "'Next month's royal wedding between Prince Gid of the Sufling Dynasty and Princess Huli of Raui Alpha will be the most spectacular ceremony the Bajanji territories has ever witnessed. "'Our reporter Trillian Astra is there and sends us this report.' "'Arthur blinked. The sound of cheering crowds and a hubbub of brass bands erupted from the radio. A very familiar voice said, "'Well, Kraut, the scene here in the middle of next month is absolutely incredible. Princess Huli is looking radiant and a—' The prophet swiped the radio off the bench and onto the dusty ground, where it squawked like a badly tuned chicken. "'See what we have to contend with?' grumbled the prophet. "'Here, hold this—' "'Not that—' "'This—' "'No, not like that—' "'This way up—' "'I was listening to that,' complained Arthur, grappling helplessly with the prophet's hammer. "'So does everybody. That's why this place is like a ghost-town,' he spat into the dust. "'No, I mean that sounded like someone I knew. Princess Huli? If I had to stand round saying hello to everybody who's known Princess Huli I'd need a new set of lungs.' "'Not the Princess,' said Arthur. "'The reporter. Her name's Trillian. I don't know where she got the Astra from. She's from the same planet as me. I wondered where she'd got to. "'No, she's all over the Continuum these days. We can't get the Tri-D TV stations out here, of course, thank the Great Green Arklesesia. But you hear her on the radio gallivanting here and there through space-time. She wants to settle down and find herself a steady earer, that young lady does. It'll all end in tears—probably already has.' He swung his hammer and hit his thumb rather hard. He started to speak in tongues. The village of oracles wasn't much better. He had been told that when looking for a good oracle it was best to find the oracle that other oracles went to. But he was shut. There was a sign by the entrance saying, I just don't know any more. Try next door, but that's just a suggestion, not formal oracular advice. Next door was a cave a few hundred yards away, and Arthur walked towards it. Smoke and steam were rising from, respectively, a small fire and a battered tin pot that was hanging over it. There was also a very nasty smell coming from the pot. At least Arthur thought it was coming from the pot. The distended bladders of some of the local goat-like things were hanging from a propped-up line, drying in the sun, and the smell could have been coming from them. There was also, a worryingly small distance away, a pile of discarded bodies of the local goat-like things, and the smell could have been coming from them. But the smell could just as easily have been coming from the old lady who was busy beating flies away from the pile of bodies. It was a hopeless task, because each of the flies was about the size of a winged bottle-top, and all she had was a table-tennis bat. Also she seemed half blind. Every now and then, by chance, her wild thrashing would connect with one of the flies with a richly satisfying thunk, and the fly would hurtle through the air and smack itself open against the rock face a few yards from the entrance to her cave. She gave every impression, by her demeanour, that these were the moments she lived for. Arthur watched this exotic performance for a while from a polite distance, and then at last tried giving a gentle cough to attract her attention. The gentle cough, courteously meant, unfortunately involved first inhaling rather more of the local atmosphere than he had so far been doing, and as a result he erupted into a fit of raucous expectoration and collapsed against the rock face, choking and streaming with tears. He struggled for breath, but each new breath made things worse. He vomited, half choked again, rolled over his own vomit, kept rolling for a few yards, and eventually made it up onto his hands and knees, and crawled panting into slightly fresher air. "'Excuse me,' he said. He got some breath back. "'I really am most dreadfully sorry. I feel a complete idiot,' and he gestured helplessly towards the small pile of his own vomit, lying spread around the entrance to her cave. "'What can I say?' he said. "'What can I possibly say?' This at least had gained her attention. She looked round at him suspiciously, but being half blind, had difficulty finding him in the blurred and rocky landscape. He waved helpfully. "'Hello!' he called. At last she spotted him, grunted to herself, and turned back to whacking flies. It was horribly apparent from the way that currents of air moved when she did, that the major source of the smell was in fact her. The drying bladders, the festering bodies, and the noxious pottage may all have been making valiant contributions to the atmosphere, but the major olfactory presence was the woman herself. She got another good thwack at a fly. It smacked against the rock and dribbled its insides down it, in what she clearly regarded, if she could see that far, as a satisfactory manner. Unsteadily Arthur got to his feet and brushed himself down with a fistful of dried grass. He didn't know what else to do by way of announcing himself. He had half a mind just to wander off again, but felt awkward about leaving a pile of his vomit in front of the entrance to the woman's home. He wondered what to do about it. He started to pluck up more hands full of the scrubby dried grass that was to be found here and there. He was worried, though, that if he ventured nearer to the vomit he might simply add to it, rather than clear it up. Just as he was debating with himself as to what the right course of action was, he began to realise that she was at last saying something to him. "'I beg your pardon,' he called out. "'I said, can I help you?' she said in a thin, scratchy voice that he could only just hear. "'I came to ask your advice,' he called back, feeling a bit ridiculous. She turned to peer at him myopically, then turned back, swiped at a fly, and missed. "'What about?' she said. "'I beg your pardon?' he said. "'I said, what about?' she almost screeched. "'Well,' said Arthur, "'just sort of her general advice, really. It's said in the brochure—' "'Ha! brochure!' spat the old woman. She seemed to be waving her bat more or less at random now. Arthur fished the crumpled-up brochure from his pocket. He wasn't quite certain why. He had already read it, and she, he expected, wouldn't want to. He unfolded it anyway, in order to have something to frown thoughtfully at for a moment or two. The copy in the brochure whitted on about the ancient mystical arts of the seers and sages of Hualius, and wildly over-represented the level of accommodation available in Hualien. Arthur still carried a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with him, but he found, when he consulted it, that the entries were becoming more abstruse and paranoid, and had lots of Xs and Js and brackets in them. Something was wrong somewhere, whether it was in his own personal unit, or whether it was something or someone going terribly amiss, or perhaps just hallucinating at the heart of the Guide organisation itself, he didn't know. But one way or another he was even less inclined to trust it than usual, which meant that he trusted it not one bit, and usually used it for eating his sandwiches off when he was sitting on a rock staring at something. The woman had turned, and was walking slowly towards him. Arthur tried, without making it too obvious, to judge the wind direction, and bobbed about a bit as she approached. "'Advice!' she said. "'Advice, eh?' "'Uh, uh, yes,' said Arthur. "'Uh, yes, that is—' He frowned again at the brochure, as if to be certain that he hadn't misread it, and stupidly turned up on the wrong planet or something. The brochure said, "'The friendly local inhabitants will be glad to share with you the knowledge and wisdom of the ancients. Peer with them into the swirling mysteries of past and future time.' There were some coupons as well, but Arthur had been far too embarrassed, actually, to cut them out, or try to present them to anybody. "'Advice, eh?' said the old woman again. "'Just sort of general advice, you say. On what? What to do with your life, that sort of thing?' "'Uh, yes,' said Arthur. "'That sort of thing. A bit of a problem I sometimes find to them, being perfectly honest.' He was trying desperately, with tiny darting movements, to stay upwind of her. She surprised him by suddenly turning sharply away from him, and heading off towards her cave. "'You'll have to help me with the photocopier, then,' she said. "'What?' said Arthur. "'The photocopier!' she repeated patiently. "'You'll have to help me drag it out. It's solar-powered. I have to keep it in the cave, though, so the birds don't shit on it.' "'I see,' said Arthur. "'I'll take a few deep breaths if I were you,' muttered the old woman, as she stomped into the gloom of the cave-mouth. Arthur did as she advised. He almost hyperventilated, in fact. When he felt he was ready, he held his breath and followed her in. The photocopier was a big old thing on a rickety trolley. It stood just inside the dim shadows of the cave. The wheels were stuck obstinately in different directions, and the ground was rough and stony. "'Go ahead and take a breath outside,' said the old woman. Arthur was going red in the face, just trying to help her move the thing. He nodded in relief. If she wasn't going to be embarrassed about it, then neither, he was determined, would he. He stepped outside and took a few breaths, then came back in to do more heaving and pushing. He had to do this quite a few times, till at last the machine was outside. The sun beat down on it. The old woman disappeared back into her cave again, and brought with her some mottled metal panels, which she connected to the machine to collect the sun's energy. She squinted up into the sky. The sky was quite bright, but the day was hazy and vague. "'It'll take a while,' she said. Arthur said he was happy to wait. The old woman shrugged and stomped across to the fire. Above it the contents of the tin can were bubbling away. She poked about at them with a stick. "'You won't be wanting any lunch?' she inquired of Arthur. "'I've eaten, thanks,' said Arthur. No, no, really, I've eaten.' "'I'm sure you have,' said the old lady. She stirred with the stick. After a few minutes she fished a lump of something out, blew on it to cool it a little, and then put it in her mouth. She chewed on it thoughtfully for a bit. Then she hobbled slowly across to the pile of dead goat-like things. She spat the lump out onto the pile. She hobbled back slowly to the can. She tried to unhook it from the sort of tripod-like thing that it was hanging from. "'Uh, can I help you?' said Arthur, jumping up politely. He hurried over. Together they disengaged the tin from the tripod, and carried it awkwardly down the slight slope that led downwards from her cave and towards a line of scrubby, unknurled trees which marked the edge of a steep but quite shallow gully, from which a whole new range of offensive smells was emanating. "'Ready?' said the old lady. "'Uh, yes,' said Arthur, though he didn't know for what. "'One,' said the old lady. "'Two,' she said. "'Three,' she added. Arthur realised just in time what she intended. Together they tossed the contents of the tin into the gully. After an hour or two of uncommunicative silence the old woman decided that the solar panels had absorbed enough sunlight to run the photocopier now, and she disappeared to rummage inside the cave. She emerged at last with a few sheaves of paper, and fed them through the machine. She handed the copies to Arthur. "'This is—uh—this is your advice, then, is it?' said Arthur, leafing through them uncertainly. "'No,' said the old lady. "'It's the story of my life. You see, the quality of any advice anybody has to offer is to be judged against the quality of life they actually lead. Now, as you look through this document you'll see that I've underlined all the major decisions I've ever made to make them stand out. They're all indexed and cross-referenced, see? All I can suggest is that if you take decisions that are exactly opposite to the sort of decisions that I've taken then maybe you won't finish up at the end of your life!' She paused and filled her lungs for a good shout. "'In a smelly old cave like this!' She grabbed up her table-tennis bat, rolled up her sleeve, stomped off to her pile of dead goat-like things, and started to set about the flies with vim and vigour. The last village Arthur visited consisted entirely of extremely high poles. They were so high that it wasn't even possible to tell from the ground what was on top of them, and Arthur had to climb three before he found one that had anything on top of it at all other than a platform covered with bird-droppings. Not an easy task. He went up the poles by climbing on the short wooden pegs that had been hammered into them in slowly ascending spirals. Anybody who was a less diligent tourist than Arthur would have taken a couple of snapshots and sloped right off to the nearest bar and grill, where he could also buy a range of particularly sweet and gooey chocolate cakes to eat in front of the ascetics. But largely as a result of this, most of the ascetics had gone now. In fact, they had mostly gone and set up lucrative therapy centres on some of the more affluent worlds in the north-west ripple of the galaxy, where the living was easier by a factor of about seventeen million, and the chocolate was just fabulous. Most of the ascetics, it turned out, had not known about chocolate before they took up asceticism. Most of the clients who came to their therapy centres knew about it all too well. At the top of the third pole Arthur stopped for a breather. He was very hot and out of breath, since each pole was about fifty or sixty feet high. The world seemed to swing vertiginously round him, but it didn't worry Arthur too much. He knew that logically he could not die until he had been to Stavromula Beta—see Light, the Universe, and Everything, Chapter 18—and had therefore managed to cultivate a merry attitude towards extreme personal danger. He felt a little giddy, perched fifty feet up in the air on top of a pole, but he dealt with it by eating a sandwich. He was just about to embark on reading the photocopied life-history of the Oracle, when he was rather startled to hear a slight cough behind him. He turned so abruptly that he dropped his sandwich, which turned downwards through the air and was rather small by the time it was stopped by the ground. About thirty feet behind Arthur was another pole, and alone amongst the sparse forest of about three dozen poles, the top of it was occupied. It was occupied by an old man, who in turn seemed to be occupied by profound thoughts that were making him scowl. "'Excuse me,' said Arthur. The man ignored him. Perhaps he couldn't hear him. The breeze was moving about a bit. It was only by chance that Arthur had heard the slight cough. "'Hullo!' called Arthur. "'Hullo!' The man at last glanced round at him. He seemed surprised to see him. Arthur couldn't tell if he was surprised and pleased to see him, or just surprised. "'Are you open?' called Arthur. The man frowned in incomprehension. Arthur couldn't tell if he couldn't understand or couldn't hear. "'I'll pop over,' called Arthur. "'Don't go away!' He clambered off the small platform and climbed quickly down the spiralling pegs, arriving at the bottom quite dizzy. He started to make his way over to the pole on which the old man was sitting, and then suddenly realised that he had disoriented himself on the way down and didn't know for certain which one it was. He looked round for landmarks and worked out which was the right one. He climbed it. It wasn't. "'Damn!' he said. "'Excuse me!' he called out to the old man again, who was now straight in front of him and forty feet away. "'Got lost! Be with you in a minute!' Then he went again, getting very hot and bothered. When he arrived, panting and sweating at the top of the pole that he knew for certain was the right one, he realised that the man was, somehow or other, mucking him about. "'What do you want?' shouted the old man crossly at him. He was now sitting on top of the pole that Arthur recognised was the one he had been sitting on himself when eating his sandwich. "'How did you get over there?' called Arthur in bewilderment. "'You think I'm going to tell you just like that what it took me forty springs, summers and autumns, of sitting on top of a pole to work out?' "'What about winter?' said Arthur. "'What about winter? Don't you sit on the pole in the winter?' "'Just because I sit on a pole for most of my life,' said the man, "'doesn't mean I'm an idiot. I go south in the winter. I've got a beach-house still on the chimney-stack.' "'Do you have any advice for a traveller?' "'Yes. Get a beach-house.' "'I see.' The man stared out over the hot, dry, scrubby landscape. From here Arthur could just see the old woman, a tiny speck in the distance, dancing up and down, swatting flies. "'You see her?' called the old man suddenly. "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'I consulted her, in fact. Fat Lord she knows. I got the beach-house because she turned it down. What advice did she give you?' "'Do exactly the opposite of everything she's done. In other words, get a beach-house.' "'I suppose so,' said Arthur. "'Well, maybe I'll get one. Hmm!' The horizon was swimming in a fetid heat-haze. "'Any other advice?' asked Arthur. "'Other than to do with real estate?' "'A beach-house isn't just real estate. It's a state of mind,' said the man. He turned and looked at Arthur. Oddly, the man's face was now only a couple of feet away. He seemed in one way to be a perfectly normal shape, but his body was sitting cross-legged on a pole forty feet away, while his face was only two feet from Arthur's. Without moving his head, and without seeming to do anything odd at all, he stood up and stepped on to the top of another pole. "'Either it was just the heat,' thought Arthur, "'or space was a different shape for him.' "'A beach-house,' he said, "'doesn't even have to be on the beach, though the best ones are. We all like to congregate,' he said, 'at boundary conditions.' "'Really?' said Arthur. "'Where land meets water, where earth meets air, where body meets mind, where space meets time, we like to be on one side and look at the other.' Arthur got terribly excited. This was exactly the sort of thing he had been promised in the brochure. Here was a man who seemed to be moving through some kind of Escher space, saying really profound things about all sorts of stuff. It was unnerving, though. The man was now stepping from pole to ground, from ground to pole, from pole to pole, from pole to horizon and back. He was making complete nonsense of Arthur's spatial universe. "'Please stop!' Arthur said suddenly. "'Can't take it, huh?' said the man. Without the slightest movement he was now back, sitting cross-legged on top of the pole forty feet in front of Arthur. "'You come to me for advice, but you can't cope with anything you don't recognise. Hm! So we'll have to tell you something you already know, but make it sound like news, eh? Well, business as usual, I suppose.' He sighed and squinted mournfully into the distance. "'Where are you from, boy?' he then said. Arthur decided to be clever. He was fed up with being mistaken for a complete idiot by everyone he ever met. "'Tell you what,' he said. "'You're a seer. Why don't you tell me?' The old man sighed again. "'I was just,' he said, passing his hand round behind his head, "'making conversation.' When he brought his hand round to the front again he had a globe of the earth spinning on his up-pointed forefinger. It was unmistakable. He put it away again. Arthur was stunned. "'How did you—' "'I can't tell you.' "'Why not? I've come all this way.' "'You cannot see what I see because you see what you see. You cannot know what I know because you know what you know. What I see and what I know cannot be added to what you see and what you know, because they are not of the same kind. Neither can it replace what you see and what you know, because that would be to replace you yourself.' "'Hang on! Can I write this down?' said Arthur, excitedly fumbling in his pocket for a pencil. "'You can pick up a copy at the Space Port,' said the old man. "'They've got racks of the stuff.' "'Oh!' said Arthur, disappointed. "'Well, isn't there anything that's perhaps a bit more specific to me?' "'Everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is specific to you. You create a universe by perceiving it, so everything in the universe you perceive is specific to you.' "'Can I get that at the Space Port, too?' he said. "'Check it out,' said the old man. "'It says in the brochure,' said Arthur, pulling it out of his pocket and looking at it again, "'that I can have a special prayer individually tailored to me and my special needs.' "'Oh, all right,' said the old man. "'Here's a prayer for you. Got a pencil?' "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'It goes like this. Let me see now. Protect me from knowing what I don't need to know. Protect me from even knowing that there are things to know that I don't know. Protect me from knowing that I decided not to know about the things that I decided not to know about. Amen. That's it. It's what you pray silently inside yourself anyway, so you may as well have it out in the open.' "'Hmm,' said Arthur. "'Well, thank you. There's another prayer that goes with it that's very important,' continued the old man. "'So you'd better jot this down, too. Okay. It goes, Lord, Lord, Lord—' it's best to put that bit in just in case, you can never be too sure—'Lord, Lord, Lord, protect me from the consequences of the above prayer. Amen. And that's it. Most of the trouble people get into in life comes from missing out that last part.' "'Ever heard of a place called Stavromula Beta?' asked Arthur. "'No.' "'Well, thank you for your help,' said Arthur. "'Don't mention it,' said the man on the pole, and vanished.'
 Anything that happens, happens. Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again. It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though.
 For about a minute Dirk remained sitting motionless in his car a few yards away from his front door. He wondered what his next move should be. A small, cautious one, he rather thought. The last thing he wanted to have to contend with at the moment was a startled eagle. He watched it intently. It stood there with a pert magnificence about its bearing, its talons gripped tightly around the edge of the stone step. From time to time it preened itself, and then peered sharply up the street and down the street, dragging one of its great talons across the stone in a deeply worrying manner. Dirk admired the creature greatly for its size and its plumage, and its general sense of extreme air-worthiness. But asking himself if he liked the way that the light from the street lamp glinted in its great glassy eye, or on the huge hook of its beak, he had to admit that he did not. The beak was a major piece of armoury. It was a beak that would frighten any animal on earth, even one that was already dead and in a tin. Its talons looked as if they could rip up a small Volvo, and it was sitting waiting on Dirk's doorstep, looking up and down the street with a gaze that was at once meaningful and mean. Dirk wondered if he should simply drive off and leave the country. Did he have his passport? No, it was at home. It was behind the door which was behind the eagle, in a drawer somewhere, or more likely lost. He could sell up. The ratio of estate agents to actual houses in the area was rapidly approaching parity. One of their lot could come and deal with the house. He'd had enough of it, with its fridges and its wildlife, and its ineradical position on the mailing-list of the American Express Company. Or he could, he supposed with a slight shiver, just go and see what it was the eagle wanted. There was a thought. Rats, probably, or a small whippet. All Dirk had, to his knowledge, were some rice-crispies and an old muffin, and he didn't see those appealing to this magisterial creature of the air. He rather fancied that he could make out fresh blood congealing on the bird's talons. But he told himself firmly not to be so ridiculous. He was just going to have to go and face up to the thing, explain that he was fresh out of rats and take the consequences. Quietly, infinitely quietly, he pushed open the door of his car and stole out of it, keeping his head down. He peered at the eagle from over the bonnet of the car. It hadn't moved. That is to say, it hadn't left the district. It was still looking this way and that around itself with, possibly, a heightened sense of alertness. Dirk didn't know in what remote mountain eerie the creature had learned to listen out for the sound of Jaguar car door hinges revolving in their sockets, but the sound had clearly not escaped its attention. Cautiously, Dirk bobbed along behind the line of cars that had prevented him from being able to park directly outside his own house. In a couple of seconds, all that separated him from the extraordinary creature was a small blue Renault. What next? He could simply stand up and, as it were, declare himself. He would be saying, in effect, Here I am. Do what you will. Whatever then transpired, the Renault would probably bear the brunt. There was always the possibility, of course, that the eagle would be pleased to see him, that all the swooping it had been directing at him had been just its way of being matey. Assuming, of course, that it was the same eagle. That was not such an enormous assumption. The number of golden eagles at large in North London at any one time was, Dirk guessed, fairly small. Or maybe it was just resting on its doorstep completely by chance, enjoying a quick breather prior to having another hurtle through the sky in pursuit of whatever it is that eagles hurtle through the sky after. Whatever the explanation, now, Dirk realized, was the time that he had simply to take his chances. He steeled himself, took a deep breath, and arose from behind the Renault like a spirit rising from the deep. The eagle was looking in another direction at the time, and it was a second or so before it looked back to the front and saw him, at which point it reacted with a loud screech and stepped back an inch or two—a reaction which Dirk felt a little put out by. It then blinked rapidly a few times and adopted a sort of perky expression, of which Dirk did not have the faintest idea what to make. He waited for a second or two, until he felt the situation had settled down again after all the foregoing excitement, and then stepped forward tentatively round the front of the Renault. A number of quiet interrogative cawing noises seemed to float uncertainly through the air, and then, after a moment, Dirk realized that he was making them himself, and made himself stop. This was an eagle he was dealing with, not a budgie. It was at this point that he made his mistake. With his mind entirely taken up with eagles, the possible intentions of eagles, and the many ways in which eagles might be considered to differ from budgies, he did not concentrate enough on what he was doing, as he stepped out of the road and on to a pavement that was slick with the recent drizzle. As he brought his rear foot forward, it caught on the bumper of the car. He wobbled, slipped, and did that thing which no one should ever do to a large eagle of uncertain temper, which was to fling himself headlong at it with his arms outstretched. The eagle reacted instantly. Without a second's hesitation, it hopped neatly aside and allowed Dirk the space he needed to collapse heavily on to his own doorstep. It then peered down at him with a scorn that would have withered a lesser man, or at least a man that had been looking up at that moment. Dirk groaned. He had sustained a blow to the temple from the edge of the step, and it was a blow he felt that he could just as easily have done without this evening. He lay there gasping for a second or two, then at last rolled over heavily, clasping one hand to his forehead, the other to his nose, and looked up at the great bird in apprehension, reflecting bitterly on the conditions under which he was expected to work. When it became clear to him that he appeared for the moment to have nothing to fear from the eagle, who was merely regarding him with a kind of quizzical blinking doubt, he sat up, and then slowly dragged himself back to his feet, and wiped and smacked some of the dirt off his coat. Then he hunted through his pockets for his keys, and unlocked the front door, which seemed a little loose. He waited to see what the eagle would do next. With the slight rustle of its wings it hopped over the lintel and into his hall. It looked around itself, and seemed to regard what it saw with a little distaste. Dirk didn't know what it was that eagles expected of people's hallways, but had to admit to himself that it wasn't only the eagle which reacted like that. The disorder was not that great, but there was a grimness to it which tended to cast a pall over visitors, and the eagle was clearly not immune to this effect. Dirk picked up a large flat envelope lying on his doormat, looked inside it to check that it was what he had been expecting, and noticed that a picture was missing from the wall. It wasn't a particularly wonderful picture, merely a small Japanese print that he had found in Camden Passage and quite liked, but the point was that it was missing. The hook on the wall was empty. There was a chair missing as well, he realized. The possible significance of this suddenly struck him, and he hurried through to the kitchen. Many of his assorted kitchen implements had clearly gone. The rack of largely unused sabatier knives, the food processor, and his radio-cassette player had all vanished, but he did, however, have a new fridge. It had obviously been delivered by Nobby Paxton's felonious thugs, and he would just have to make the usual little list. Still, he had a new fridge, and that was a considerable load off his mind. Already the whole atmosphere in the kitchen seemed easier. The tension had lifted. There was a new sense of lightness and springiness in the air, which had even communicated itself to the pile of old pizza-boxes, which seemed now to recline at a jaunty rather than an oppressive angle. Dirk cheerfully threw open the door to the new fridge, and was delighted to find it completely and utterly empty. Its inner light shone on perfectly clean blue and white walls, and on gleaming chrome shelves. He liked it so much that he instantly determined to keep it like that. He would put nothing in it at all. His food would simply have to go off in plain view. Good! He closed it again. A screech and a flap behind him reminded him that he was entertaining a visiting eagle. He turned to find it glaring at him from on top of the kitchen table. Now that he was getting a little more accustomed to it, and had not actually been viciously attacked as he had suspected he might be, it seemed a little less fearsome than it had at first. It was still a serious amount of eagle, but perhaps an eagle was a slightly more manageable proposition than he had originally supposed. He relaxed a little and took off his hat, pulled off his coat, and threw them onto a chair. The eagle seemed at this juncture to sense that Dirk might be getting the wrong idea about it, and flexed one of its claws at him. With sudden alarm Dirk saw that it did indeed have something that closely resembled congealed blood on its talons. He backed away from it hurriedly. The eagle then rose up to its full height on its talons, and began to spread its great wings out, wider and wider, beating them very slowly, and leaning forward so as to keep its balance. Dirk did the only thing he could think of to do under the circumstances, and bolted from the room, slamming the door behind him and jamming the whole table up against it. A terrible cacophony of screeching and scratching and buffeting arose instantly from behind it. Dirk sat leaning back against the table, panting and trying to catch his breath, and then, after a while, began to get a worrying feeling about what the bird was up to now. It seemed to him that the eagle was actually dive-bombing itself against the door. Every few seconds the pattern would repeat itself, first a great beating of wings, then a rush, then a terrible cracking thud. Dirk didn't think it would get through the door, but was alarmed that it might beat itself to death trying. The creature seemed to be quite frantic about something, but what, Dirk could not even begin to imagine. He tried to calm himself down and think clearly, to work out what he should do next. He should phone Kate and make certain she was all right. WHOOSH! THUD! He should finally open up the envelope he had been carrying with him all day and examine its contents. WHOOSH! THUD! For that he would need a sharp knife. WHOOSH! THUD! Three rather awkward thoughts then struck him in fairly quick succession. First, the only sharp knives in the place, assuming Nobby's removal people had left him with any at all, were in the kitchen. WHOOSH! THUD! That didn't matter so much in itself, because he could probably find something in the house that would do. WHOOSH! THUD! The second thought was that the actual envelope itself was in the pocket of his coat, which he had left lying over the back of a chair in the kitchen. WHOOSH! THUD! The third thought was very similar to the second, and had to do with the location of the piece of paper with Kate's telephone number on it. WHOOSH! THUD! Oh, God! Dirk began to feel very, very tired at the way the day was working out. He was deeply worried by the sense of impending calamity, but was still by no means able to divine what lay at the root of it. WHOOSH! THUD! Well, he knew what he had to do now. WHOOSH! THUD! So there was no point in not getting on with it. He quietly pulled the table away from the door. WHOOSH! He ducked and yanked the door open, passing smoothly under the eagle as it hurtled out into the hallway and hit the opposite wall. He slammed the door closed behind him from inside the kitchen, pulled his coat off the chair, and jammed the chair back up under the handle. WHOOSH! THUD! The damage done to the door on this side was both considerable and impressive, and Dirk began seriously to worry about what this behaviour said about the bird's state of mind, or what the bird's state of mind might become if it maintained this behaviour for very much longer. WHOOSH! SCRATCH! The same thought seemed to have occurred to the bird at that moment, and after a brief flurry of screeching and scratching at the door with its talons it lapsed into a grumpy and defeated silence, which after it had been going on for about a minute became almost as disturbing as the previous batterings. Dirk wondered what it was up to. He approached the door cautiously, and very, very quietly moved the chair back a little so that he could see through the keyhole. He squatted down and peered through it. At first it seemed to him that he could see nothing through it, that it must be blocked by something. Then a slight flicker and glint close up on the other side suddenly revealed the startling truth, which was that the eagle also had an eye up at the keyhole and was busy looking back at him. Dirk almost toppled backwards with the shock of the realisation, and backed away from the door with a sense of slight horror and revulsion. This was extremely intelligent behaviour for an eagle, wasn't it? Was it? How could he find out? He couldn't think of any ornithological experts to phone. All his reference books were piled up in other rooms of the house, and he didn't think he'd be able to keep on pulling off the same stunt with impunity, certainly not when he was dealing with an eagle which had managed to figure out what keyholes were for. He retreated to the kitchen sink and found some kitchen towel. He folded it into a wad, soaked it, and dabbed it first on his bleeding temple, which was swelling up nicely, and then on his nose, which was still very tender, and had been a considerable size for most of the day now. Maybe the eagle was an eagle of delicate sensibilities, and had reacted badly to the sight of Dirk's face in its current much-abused state, and had simply lost its mind. Dirk sighed and sat down. Kate's telephone, which was the next thing he turned his attention to, was answered by a machine when he tried to ring it. Her voice told him, very sweetly, that he was welcome to leave a message after the beep, but warned that she hardly ever listened to them and that it was much better to talk to her directly, and he couldn't because she wasn't in, so he'd best try again. "'Thank you very much,' he thought, and put the phone down. He realized that the truth of the matter was this. He had spent the day putting off opening the envelope because of what he was worried about finding in it. It wasn't that the idea was frightening, though indeed it was frightening that a man should sell his soul to a green-eyed man with a scythe—which is what circumstances were trying very hard to suggest had happened—it was just that it was extremely depressing that he should sell it to a green-eyed man with a scythe in exchange for a share in the royalties of a hit record. That was what it looked like on the face of it, wasn't it? Dirk picked up the other envelope—the one which had been waiting for him on his doormat—delivered there by a courier from a large London bookshop, where Dirk had an account. He pulled out the contents, which were a copy of the sheet music of Hot Potato, written by Colin Paynton, Phil Mulville, and Jeff Anstey. The lyrics were, well, straight-forward. They provided a basic repetitive bit of funk rhythm and a simple sense of menace and cheerful callousness which had caught the mood of last summer. They went— Hot Potato Don't pick it up, pick it up, pick it up Quick pass it on, pass it on, pass it on You don't want to get caught, get caught, get caught Drop it on someone, who, who, anybody You better not have it when the big one comes I said you better not have it when the big one comes It's a hot potato And so on. The repeated phrases got tossed backwards and forwards between the two members of the band. The drum-machine got heavier and heavier, and there had been a dance-video. Was that all it was going to be? Big deal—a nice house in Lupton Street with polyurethane floors and a broken marriage. Things had certainly come down a long way since the great days of Faust and Mephistopheles, when a man could gain all the knowledge of the universe, achieve all the ambitions of his mind, and all the pleasures of the flesh for the price of his soul. Now it was a few record royalties, a few pieces of trendy furniture, a trinket to stick on your bathroom wall, and a whap your head comes off. So what exactly was the deal? What was the potato contract? Who was getting what, and why? Dirk rummaged through a drawer for the bread-knife, sat down once more, took the envelope from his coat-pocket, and ripped through the congealed strata of Scotch-tape which held the end of it together. Out fell a thick bundle of papers.
 Chapter 3. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has, in what we laughingly call the past, had a great deal to say on the subject of parallel universes. Very little of this is, however, at all comprehensible to anyone below the level of advanced God, and since it is now well established that all known gods came into existence a good three millionths of a second after the universe began, rather than, as they usually claimed, the previous week, they already have a great deal of explaining to do as it is, and are therefore not available for comment on matters of deep physics at this time. One encouraging thing that the Guide does have to say on the subject of parallel universes is that you don't stand the remotest chance of understanding it. You can therefore say, what, and A, and even go cross-eyed and start to blither, if you like, without any fear of making a fool of yourself. The first thing to realize about parallel universes, the Guide says, is that they are not parallel. It is also important to realize that they are not, strictly speaking, universes either, but it is easiest if you try and realize that a little later, after you've realized that everything you've realized up to that moment is not true. The reason they are not universes is that any given universe is not actually a thing as such, but is just a way of looking at what is technically known as the WSOGMM, or Whole Sort of General Mishmash. The whole sort of general mishmash doesn't actually exist either, but is just the sum total of all the different ways there would be of looking at it if it did. The reason they are not parallel is the same reason that the C is not parallel. It doesn't mean anything. You can slice the whole sort of general mishmash any way you like, and will generally come up with something that someone will call home. Please feel free to blither now. The Earth with which we are here concerned, because of its particular orientation in the whole sort of general mishmash, was hit by a neutrino that other Earths were not. A neutrino is not a big thing to be hit by. In fact, it's hard to think of anything much smaller by which one could reasonably hope to be hit. And it's not as if being hit by neutrinos was in itself a particularly unusual event for something the size of the Earth. Far from it. It would be an unusual nanosecond in which the Earth was not hit by several billion passing neutrinos. It all depends on what you mean by hit. Of course, seeing as matter consists almost entirely of nothing at all, the chances of a neutrino actually hitting something as it travels through all this howling emptiness are roughly comparable to that of dropping a ball bearing at random from a cruising 747 and hitting, say, an egg sandwich. Anyway, this neutrino hit something. Nothing terribly important in the scale of things, you might say. But the problem with saying something like that is that you will be talking cross-eyed badger spit. Once something actually happens somewhere in something as wildly complicated as the universe, Kevin knows where it'll all end up. Where Kevin is any random entity that doesn't know nothing about nothing. This neutrino struck an atom. The atom was part of a molecule. A molecule was part of a nucleic acid. The nucleic acid was part of a gene. The gene was part of a genetic recipe for growing and so on. The upshot was that a plant ended up growing an extra leaf in Essex, or what would, after a lot of palaver and local difficulties of a geological nature, become Essex. The plant was a clover. It threw its weight, or rather its seed, around extremely effectively and rapidly became the world's dominant type of clover. The precise causal connection between this tiny biological happenstance and a few other minor variations that exist in that slice of the whole sort of general mishmash, such as Tricia Macmillan failing to leave with Xaphor Beeblebrox, abnormally low sales of pecan-flavoured ice cream, and the fact that the Earth on which all this occurred did not get demolished by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, is currently sitting at number 4,763,984,132 on the Research Project Priority List at what was once the History Department of the University of Maxime-Mégalon. And no one currently at the prayer meeting by the poolside appears to feel any sense of urgency about the problem.
 The sheets which tumbled out onto Dirk's kitchen table were made of thick, heavy paper, folded together, and had obviously been much handled. He sorted them out, one by one, separating them from each other, smoothing them out with the flat of his hand, and laying them out neatly in rows on the kitchen table, clearing a space, as it became necessary, among the old newspapers, ashtrays, and dirty cereal bowls, which Jelena the cleaner always left exactly where they were, claiming, when challenged on this, that she thought he had put them there specially. He pored over the papers for several minutes, moving from one to another, comparing them with each other, studying them carefully, page by page, paragraph by paragraph, line by line. He couldn't understand a word of them. It should have occurred to him, he realized, that the green-eyed, hairy, scythe-waving giant might differ from him not only in general appearance and personal habits, but also in such matters as the alphabet he favoured. He sat back in his seat, disgruntled and thwarted, and reached for a cigarette, but the packet in his coat was now empty. He picked up a pencil and tapped it in a cigarette-like way, but it wasn't able to produce the same effect. After a minute or two he became acutely conscious of the fact that he was probably still being watched through the keyhole by the eagle, and he found that this made it impossibly hard to concentrate on the problem before him, particularly without a cigarette. He scowled to himself. He knew there was still a packet upstairs by his bed, but he didn't think he could handle the sheer ornithology involved in going to get it. He tried to stare at the papers for a little longer. The writing, apart from being written in some kind of small, crabby and indecipherable runic script, was mostly hunched up towards the left-hand side of the paper, as if swept there by a tide. The right-hand side was largely clear, except for an occasional group of characters which were lined up underneath each other. All of it, except for a slight sense of indefinable familiarity about the layout, was completely meaningless to Dirk. He turned his attention back to the envelope instead, and tried once more to examine some of the names which had been so heavily crossed out. Howard Bell, the incredibly wealthy, best-selling novelist, who wrote bad books which sold by the warehouse load despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that nobody read them. Dennis Hutch, record company magnate. Now that he had a context for the name, Dirk knew it perfectly well. The Aries Rising Record Group, which had been founded on Sixties ideals, or at least what passed for ideals in the Sixties, grown in the Seventies, and then embraced the materialism of the Eighties without missing a beat, was now a massive entertainment conglomerate on both sides of the Atlantic. Dennis Hutch had stepped up into the top seat, when its founder had died of a lethal overdose of brick wool, taken while under the influence of a Ferrari and a bottle of tequila. Arrgh! was also the record label on which Hot Potato had been released. Stan Dubcek, senior partner in the advertising company with the silly name, which now owned most of the British and American advertising companies, which had not had names which were quite as silly, and had therefore been swallowed whole. And here, suddenly, was another name that was instantly recognisable, now that Dirk was attuned to the sort of names he should be looking for. Roderick Mercer, the world's greatest publisher of the world's sleaziest newspapers. Dirk hadn't at first spotted the name with the unfamiliar URIK in place after the rod. Well, well, well. Now here were people, thought Dirk suddenly, who had really got something. Certainly they'd got rather more than a nice little house in Lupton Road, with some dried flowers lying around the place. They also had the great advantage of having heads on their shoulders as well, unless Dirk had missed something new and dramatic on the news. What did all that mean? What was this contract? How come everybody whose hands it had been through had been so astoundingly successful except for one—Geoffrey Anstey? Everybody whose hands it had passed through had benefited from it except for the one who had it last, who had still got it. It was a hot potato. You better not have it when the big one comes. The notion suddenly formed in Dirk's mind that it might have been Geoffrey Anstey himself who had overheard a conversation about a hot potato—about getting rid of it, passing it on. If he remembered correctly the interview he had read with Paine, he didn't say that he himself had overheard the conversation. You better not have it when the big one comes. The notion was a horrible one, and ran on like this. Geoffrey Anstey had been pathetically naive. He had overheard this conversation between—who? Dirk picked up the envelope and ran over the list of names—and had thought that it had a good dance rhythm. He had not for a moment realised that what he was listening to was a conversation that would result in his own hideous death. He had got a hit record out of it, and when the real hot potato was actually handed to him he had picked it up. Don't pick it up, pick it up, pick it up. And instead of taking the advice he had recorded in the words of the song—quick pass it on, pass it on, pass it on—he had stuck it behind the gold record award on his bathroom wall. You better not have it when the big one comes. Dirk frowned and took a long, slow, thoughtful drag on his pencil. This was ridiculous. He had to get some cigarettes if he was going to think this thing through with any intellectual rigour. He pulled on his coat, stuffed his hat on his head, and made for the window. The window hadn't been opened for—well, certainly not during his ownership of the house, and it struggled and screamed at the sudden unaccustomed invasion of its space and independence. Once he had forced it wide enough, Dirk struggled out onto the windowsill, pulling swathes of leather coat out with him. From here it was a bit of a jump to the pavement, since there was a lower ground floor to the house, with a narrow flight of steps leading down to it in the front. A line of iron railings separated these from the pavement, and Dirk had to get clear over these. Without hesitating for a moment he made the jump, and it was in mid-bound that he realised he had not picked up his car keys from the kitchen table where he had left them. He considered, as he sailed gracelessly through the air, whether or not to execute a wild mid-air twist, make a desperate grab backwards for the window, and hope that he might just manage to hold on to the sill, but decided on mature reflection that an error at this point might just conceivably kill him, whereas the walk would probably do him good. He landed heavily on the far side of the railings, but the tails of his coat became entangled with them, and he had to pull them off, tearing part of the lining in the process. Once the ringing shock in his knees had subsided, and he had recovered what little composure the events of the day had left him with, he realised that it was now well after eleven o'clock, and the pubs would be shut, and he might have a longer walk than he had bargained for to find some cigarettes. He considered what to do. The current outlook and state of mind of the Eagle was a major factor to be taken into account here. The only way to get his car keys now was back through the front door into his eagle-infested hallway. Moving with great caution, he tiptoed back up the steps to his front door, squatted down, and, hoping that the damn thing wasn't going to squeak, gently pushed up the flap of the letter-box and peered through. In an instant a talon was hooked into the back of his hand, and a great screeching beak slashed at his eye, narrowly missing it, but scratching a great gouge across his much-abused nose. Dirk howled with pain and lurched backwards, not getting very far, because he still had a talon hooked in his hand. He lashed out desperately, and hit at the talon, which hurt him considerably, dug the sharp point even further into his flesh, and caused a great barging flurry on the other side of the door, each tiniest movement of which tugged heavily in his hand. He grabbed at the great claw with his free hand and tried to tug it back out of himself. It was immensely strong, and was shaking with the fury of the eagle, which was as trapped as he was. At last, quivering with pain, he managed to release himself, and pulled his injured hand back, nursing and cuddling it with the other. The eagle pulled its claw back sharply, and Dirk heard it flapping away back down his hallway, emitting terrible screeches and cries, its great wings colliding with and scraping the walls. Dirk toyed with the idea of burning the house down, but once the throbbing in his hand had begun to subside a little, he calmed down and tried, if he could, to see things from the eagle's point of view. He couldn't. He had not the faintest idea how things appeared to eagles in general, much less to this particular eagle, who had seemed to be a seriously deranged example of the species. After a minute or so more of nursing his hand, curiosity, allied to a strong sense that the eagle had definitely retreated to the far end of the hall and stayed there, overcame him, and he bent down once more to the letterbox. This time he used his pencil to push the flap back upwards, and scanned the hallway from a safe position a good few inches back. The eagle was clearly in view, perched on the end of the banister rail, regarding him with resentment and opprobrium, which Dirk felt was a little rich coming from a creature which had only a moment or two earlier been busily engaged in trying to rip his hand off. Then, once the eagle was certain that it had got Dirk's attention, it slowly raised itself up on its feet, and slowly shook its great wings out, beating them gently for balance. It was this gesture that had previously caused Dirk to bolt prudently from the room. This time, however, he was safely behind a couple of good- Have you got the money for a cup of tea, mate? Yes, thank you, said Dirk. I'm fine. His attention was fully occupied with the eagle, and he didn't immediately look round. No, I mean, can you spare me a bob or two, just for a cup of tea? What? This time Dirk looked round irritably. Oh, just a fag, mate. Got a fag you can spare? No, I was just going to go and get some myself, said Dirk. The man on the pavement behind him was a tramp of indeterminate age. He was standing there, slightly wobbly, with a look of wild and continuous disappointment bobbing in his eyes. Not getting an immediate response from Dirk, the man dropped his eyes to the ground about a yard in front of him, and swayed back and forth a little. He was holding his arms out, slightly open, slightly away from his body, and just swaying. Then he frowned suddenly at the ground, then he frowned at another part of the ground. Then, holding himself steady, while he made quite a major realignment of his head, he frowned away down the street. Have you lost something? said Dirk. The man's head swayed back towards him. Have I lost something? he said in querulous astonishment. Have I lost something? It seemed to be the most astounding question he had ever heard. He looked away again for a while, and seemed to be trying to balance the question in the general scale of things. This involved a fair bit more swaying and a fair few more frowns. At last he seemed to come up with something that might do service as some kind of answer. The sky, he said, challenging Dirk to find this a good enough answer. He looked up towards it, carefully, so as not to lose his balance. He seemed not to like what he saw in the dim orange street-lit pallor of the clouds, and slowly looked back down again till he was staring at a point just in front of his feet. The ground, he said, with evident great dissatisfaction, and then was struck with a sudden thought. Frogs, he said, wobbling his gaze up to meet Dirk's rather bewildered one. I used to like frogs, he said, and left his gaze sitting on Dirk, as if that was all he had to say, and the rest was entirely up to Dirk now. Dirk was completely flummoxed. He longed for the times when life had been easy, life had been carefree, the great times he had had with a mere homicidal eagle, which seemed now to be such an easygoing and amiable companion, aerial attack he could cope with, but not this nameless roaring guilt that came howling at him out of nowhere. What do you want? he said in a strangled voice. Just a fag, mate, said the tramp. Or something for a cup of tea? Dirk pressed a pound coin into the man's hand and lunged off down the street in a panic, passing twenty yards further on a builder's skip, from which the shape of his old fridge loomed at him menacingly.
 Chapter 14 As the Guide folded itself back into a smooth, dark disc, Ford realised some pretty hectic stuff—or at least he tried to realise it, but it was too hectic to take in all in one go. His head was hammering, his ankle was hurting, and though he didn't like to be a wimp about his ankle, he always found that intense multi-dimensional logic was something he understood best in the bath. He needed time to think about this—time, a tall drink, and some kind of rich foamy oil. He had to get out of here. He had to get the Guide out of here. He didn't think they'd make it together. He glanced wildly round the room. Think, think, think. It had to be something simple and obvious. If he was right in his nasty lurking suspicion that he was dealing with nasty lurking Vogons, then the more simple and obvious the better. Suddenly he saw what he needed. He wouldn't try to beat the system, he would just use it. The frightening thing about the Vogons was their absolute mindless determination to do whatever mindless thing it was they were determined to do. There was never any point in trying to appeal to their reason because they didn't have one. However, if you kept your nerve you could sometimes exploit their blinkered, bludgeoning insistence on being bludgeoning and blinkered. It wasn't merely that their left hand didn't always know what their right hand was doing, so to speak. Quite often their right hand had a pretty hazy notion as well. Did he dare just post the thing to himself? Did he dare just put it in the system and let the Vogons work out how to get the thing to him, while at the same time they were busy, as they presumably would be, tearing the building apart to find out where he'd hidden it? Yes. Feverishly he packed it. He wrapped it. He labelled it. With a moment's pause to wonder if he really was doing the right thing he committed the package to the building's internal mail chute. "'Colin,' he said, turning to the little hovering ball, "'I'm going to abandon you to your fate.' "'I'm so happy,' said Colin. "'Make the most of it,' said Ford, "'because what I want you to do is nurse-maid that package out of the building. They'll probably incinerate you when they find you, and I won't be here to help. It'll be very, very nasty for you, and that's just too bad. Got it?' "'I gurgle with pleasure,' said Colin. "'Go,' said Ford. Colin obediently dived down the mail chute in pursuit of his charge. Now Ford had only himself to worry about, but that was still quite a substantial worry. There were noises of heavy running footsteps outside the door, which he had taken the precaution of locking and shifting a large filing cabinet in front of. He was worried that everything had gone so smoothly, everything had fitted terribly well, he'd hurtled through the day with reckless abandon and yet everything had worked out with uncanny neatness. Now except for his shoe—he was bitter about his shoe—that was an account that was going to have to be settled. With a deafening roar the door exploded inwards. In the turmoil of smoke and dust he could see large slug-like creatures hurrying through. So everything was going well, was it? Everything was working out as if the most extraordinary luck was on his side. Well, he'd see about that. In a spirit of scientific inquiry he hurled himself out of the window again.'
 XXI. Misty grey buildings loomed and flickered. They bounced up and down in a highly embarrassing way. What sort of buildings were they? What were they for? What did they remind her of? It's so difficult to know what things are supposed to be when you suddenly turn up unexpectedly on a different world which has a different culture, a different set of the most basic assumptions about life, and also incredibly dull and meaningless architecture. The sky above the buildings was a hostile and cold black. The stars, which should have been blindingly brilliant points of light this far from the sun, were blurred and dulled by the thickness of the huge shielding bubble. Perspex or something like it—something dull and heavy, anyway. Tricia wound the tape back again to the beginning. She knew there was something slightly odd about it. Well, in fact, there were about a million things that were slightly odd about it, but there was one thing that was nagging at her, and she hadn't quite got it. She sighed and yawned. As she waited for the tape to rewind, she cleared away some of the dirty polystyrene coffee cups that had accumulated on the editing desk, and tipped them into the bin. She was sitting in a small editing suite at a video production company in Soho. She had Do Not Disturb notices plastered all over the door, and a block on all incoming calls at the switchboard. This was originally to protect her astonishing scoop, but now it was to protect her from embarrassment. She would watch the tape all the way through again from the beginning, if she could bear to. She might do some fast-forwarding here and there. It was about four o'clock on Monday afternoon, and she had a kind of sick feeling. She was trying to work out what the cause of this slightly sick feeling was, and there was no shortage of candidates. First of all, it had all come on top of the overnight flight from New York. The red eye. Always a killer, that. Then, being accosted by aliens on her lawn and flown to the planet Rupert. She was not sufficiently experienced in that sort of thing to be able to say for sure that that was always a killer, but she would be prepared to bet that those who went through it regularly cursed it. There were always stress charts being published in magazines. Fifty stress points for losing your job, seventy-five points for a divorce or changing your hairstyle and so on. None of them ever mentioned being accosted on your lawn by aliens and then being flown to the planet Rupert, but she was sure it was worth a few dozen points. It wasn't that the journey had been particularly stressful. It had been extremely dull, in fact. Certainly it had been no more stressful than the trip she had just taken across the Atlantic, and it had taken roughly the same time—about seven hours. Well, that was pretty astounding, wasn't it? Flying to the outer limits of the solar system in the same time that it took to fly from New York meant they must have some fantastic unheard-of form of propulsion in the ship. She quizzed her hosts about it, and they agreed that it was pretty good. But how does it work? she had demanded excitedly. She was still quite excited at the beginning of the trip. She found that part of the tape and played it through to herself. The Grebulons, which is what they called themselves, were politely showing her which buttons they pressed to make the ship go. Yes, but what principle does it work on? she heard herself demand from behind the camera. Oh, you mean, is it something like a warp-drive or something like that? they said. Yes, but, Sister Tricia, what is it? It probably is something of the kind, they said. Like what? Warp-drive, photon-drive, something like that. You'd have to ask the flight engineer. Which one is he? We don't know. We have all lost our minds, you see. Oh, yes, said Tricia, a little faintly. So you said. How did you lose your minds exactly, then? We don't know, they said patiently. Because you've lost your minds, echoed Tricia glumly. Would you like to watch television? It is a long flight. We watch television. It is something we enjoy. All of this riveting stuff was on the tape, and fine viewing it made. First of all, the picture quality was extremely poor. Tricia didn't know why this was, exactly. She had a feeling that the Grebulons responded to a slightly different range of light frequencies, and that there had been a lot of ultraviolet around, which was mucking up the video camera. There were a lot of interference patterns and video snow as well, probably something to do with the warp-drive that none of them knew the first thing about. So what she had on tape, essentially, was a bunch of slightly thin and discoloured people sitting around watching televisions that were showing network broadcasts. She had also pointed the camera out of the very tiny viewport near her seat, and got a nice, slightly streaky effect of stars. She knew it was real, but it would have taken a good three or four minutes to fake. In the end she had decided to save her precious videotape for Rupert itself, and had simply sat back and watched television with them. She even dozed off for a while. So part of her sick feeling came from the sense that she had had all that time in an alien spacecraft of astounding technological design, and had spent most of it dozing in front of reruns of MASH and Cagney and Lacey. But what else was there to do? She had taken some photos as well, of course, all of which had subsequently turned out to be badly fogged when she got them back from the chemist. Another part of her sick feeling probably came from the landing on Rupert. This at least had been dramatic and hair-raising. The ship had come sweeping in over a dark and sombre landscape, a terrain so desperately far removed from the heat and light of its parent sun, Sol, that it seemed like a map of the psychological scars of the mind of an abandoned child. Lights blazed through the frozen darkness, and guided the ship into the mouth of some kind of cave that seemed to bend itself open to accept the small craft. Unfortunately, because of the angle of their approach, and the depth at which the small thick viewport was set into the craft's skin, it hadn't been possible to get the video-camera to point directly at any of it. She ran through that bit of the tape. The camera was pointing directly at the sun. This is normally very bad for a video-camera, but when the sun is roughly a third of a billion miles away it doesn't do any harm. In fact, it hardly makes any impression at all. You just get a small point of light right in the middle of the frame, which could be just about anything. It was just one star in a multitude. Tricia fast-forwarded. Ah! Now the next bit had been quite promising. They had emerged out of the ship into a vast grey hangar-like structure. This was clearly alien technology on a dramatic scale. Huge grey buildings under the dark canopy of the perspex bubble. These were the same buildings that she had been looking at at the end of the tape. She had taken more footage of them while leaving Rupert a few hours later, just as she was about to re-board the spacecraft for the journey home. What did they remind her of? Well, as much as anything else, they reminded her of a film set from just about any low-budget science fiction movie of the last twenty years. A lot larger, of course, but it all looked thoroughly tawdry and unconvincing on the video screen. Apart from the dreadful picture quality, she had been struggling with the unexpected effects of gravity that was appreciably lower than that on earth, and she had found it very hard to keep the camera from bouncing around in an embarrassingly unprofessional way. It was therefore impossible to make out any detail. And now here was the leader coming forward to greet her, smiling and sticking his hand out. That was what he was called—the leader. None of the Grebulons had names, largely because they couldn't think of any. Tricia discovered that some of them had thought of calling themselves after characters from television programmes they had picked up from earth, but hard as they had tried to call each other Wayne and Bobby and Chuck, some remnant of something lurking deep in the cultural subconscious they had brought with them from the distant stars which were their home, must have told them that this really wasn't right and wouldn't do. The leader had looked pretty much like all the others, possibly a little less thin. He said how much she enjoyed her shows on TV, that he was her greatest fan, how glad he was that she had been able to come along and visit them on Rupert, and how much everybody had been looking forward to her coming, how he hoped the flight had been comfortable, and so on. There was no particular sense she could detect of being any kind of emissary from the stars or anything. Certainly, watching it now on videotape, he just looked like some guy in costume and make-up, standing in front of a set that wouldn't hold up too well if you leant against it. She sat staring at the screen, with her face cradled in her hands, and shaking her head in slow bewilderment. This was awful. Not only was this bit awful, but she knew what was coming next. It was the bit where the leader asked if she was hungry after the flight, and would she perhaps like to come and have something to eat. They could discuss things over a little dinner. She could remember what she was thinking at this point. Alien food. How was she going to deal with it? Would she actually have to eat it? Would she have access to some sort of paper napkin she could spit stuff out into? Wouldn't there be all sorts of differential immunity problems? It turned out to be hamburgers. Not only did it turn out to be hamburgers, but the hamburgers it turned out to be were very clearly and obviously McDonald's hamburgers, which had been reheated in a microwave. It wasn't just the look of them, it wasn't just the smell, it was the polystyrene clamshell packages they came in, which had McDonald's printed all over them. "'Eat, enjoy,' said the leader. "'Nothing is too good for our honoured guest.' This was in his private apartment. Tricia looked around it in bewilderment, that had bordered on fear, but had nevertheless got it all on videotape. The apartment had a water-bed in it, and a MIDI hi-fi, and one of those tall electrically illuminated glass things which sit on table-tops, and appear to have large globules of sperm floating about in them. The walls were covered in velvet. The leader lounged against a brown corduroy bean-bag and squirted breath-freshener into his mouth. Tricia began to feel very scared suddenly. She was further from earth than any human being to her knowledge had ever been, and she was with an alien creature who was lounging against a brown corduroy bean-bag and squirting breath-freshener into his mouth. She didn't want to make any false moves, she didn't want to alarm him, but there were things she had to know. "'How did you—where did you get—this?' she asked, gesturing around the room nervously. "'The decor?' asked the leader. "'Do you like it? It is very sophisticated. We are a sophisticated people, we Grebulons. We buy sophisticated consumer durables by mail-order.' Tricia had nodded tremendously slowly at this point. "'Mail-order,' she had said. The leader chuckled. It was one of those dark-chocolate, reassuring, silky chuckles. "'I think you think they ship it here? No! Ha, ha, ha! We have arranged a special box-number in New Hampshire. We make regular pick-up visits. Ha, ha!' He lounged back in a relaxed fashion on his bean-bag, reached for a reheated French fry, and nibbled the end of it, an amused smile playing across his lips. Tricia could feel her brain beginning to bubble very slightly. She kept the video-camera going. "'How do you—well, how do you pay for these wonderful things?' The leader chuckled again. "'American Express,' he said, with an orchid shrug. Tricia nodded slowly at this time. She knew that they gave cards exclusively to just about anybody. "'And these?' she said, holding up the hamburger he had presented her with. "'It is very easy,' said the leader. "'We stand in line.' Again Tricia realised the cold, trickling feeling going down her spine. That explained an awful lot. She hit the fast-forward button again. There was nothing of any use here at all. It was all nightmarish madness. She could have faked something that would have looked more convincing. Another sick feeling began to creep over her as she watched this hopeless awful tape, and she began with slow horror to realise that it must be the answer. "'She must be—' she shook her head and tried to get a grip. An overnight flight going east. The sleeping-pills she had taken to get her through it. The vodka she had had to set the sleeping-pills going. What else? Well, there were seventeen years of obsession that a glamorous man with two heads, one of which was disguised as a parrot in a cage, had tried to pick her up at a party, but had then impatiently flown off to another planet in a flying saucer. There suddenly seemed to be all sorts of bothersome aspects to that idea that had never really occurred to her. Never occurred to her. In seventeen years. She stuffed her fist into her mouth. She must get help. Then there had been Eric Bartlett banging on about alien spacecraft landing on her lawn, and before that—'New York had been well, very hot and stressful. The high hopes and the bitter disappointment, the astrology stuff. She must have had a nerve. A nervous breakdown. That was it. She was exhausted, and she had had a nervous breakdown, and had started hallucinating some time after she got home. She had dreamt the whole story. An alien race of people dispossessed of their own lives and histories, stuck on a remote outpost of our solar system, and filling their cultural vacuum with our cultural junk. It was Nature's way of telling her to check into an expensive medical establishment very quickly. She was very, very sick. She looked at how many large coffees she had got through as well, and realised how heavily she was breathing and how fast. Part of solving any problem she told herself was realising that you had it. She started to bring her breathing under control. She had caught herself in time. She had seen where she was. She was on the way back from whatever psychological precipice she had been on the brink of. She started to calm down, to calm down, to calm down. She sat back in the chair and closed her eyes. After a while, now that she was breathing normally again, she opened them again. So where had she got this tape from, then? It was still running. All right, it was a fake. She had faked it herself. That was it. It must have been her who had faked it, because her voice was all over the soundtrack, asking questions. Every now and then the camera would swing down at the end of a shot, and she would see her own feet in her own shoes. She had faked it, and she had no recollection of faking it, or any idea of why she had done it. Her breathing was getting hectic again as she watched the snowy, flickering screen. She must still be hallucinating. She shook her head, trying to make it go away. She had no memory of faking any of this very obviously fake stuff. On the other hand, she did seem to have memories that were very like the fake stuff. She continued to watch in a bewildered trance. The person she imagined to be called the Leader was questioning her about astrology, and she was answering smoothly and calmly. Only she could detect the well-disguised rising panic in her own voice. The Leader pushed a button, and a maroon velvet wall slid aside, revealing a large bank of flat TV monitors. Each of the monitors was showing a kaleidoscope of different images. A few seconds from a game show, a few seconds from a cop show, a few seconds from a supermarket warehouse security system, a few seconds from somebody's holiday movies, a few seconds of sex, a few seconds of news, a few seconds of comedy. It was clear that the Leader was very proud of all this stuff, and he was waving his hands like a conductor while continuing at the same time to talk complete gibberish. Another wave of his hands, and all the screens cleared to form one giant computer screen, showing in diagrammatic form all the planets of the Solar System, mapped out against the background of the stars in their constellations. The display was completely static. "'We have great skills,' the Leader was saying. "'Great skills in computation, in cosmological trigonometry, in three-dimensional navigational calculus. Great skills, great, great skills. Only we have lost them. It is too bad. We like to have skills, only they have gone. They are in space somewhere, hurtling. With our names and the details of our homes and loved ones. Please,' he said, gesturing her forward to sit at the computer's console, "'be skillful for us.'" Obviously what happened next was that Tricia quickly set the video camera up on its tripod to capture the whole scene. She then walked into shot herself, and sat down calmly in front of the giant computer display, spent a few moments familiarising herself with the interface, and then started smoothly and competently to pretend that she had the faintest idea what she was doing. It hadn't been that difficult, in fact. She was, after all, a mathematician and astrophysicist by training, and a television presenter by experience, and what science she had forgotten over the years she is more than capable of making up by bluffing. The computer she was working on was clear evidence that the Grebulons came from a far more advanced and sophisticated culture than their current vacuous state suggested, and with its aid she was able, within about half an hour, to cobble together a rough working model of the solar system. It wasn't particularly accurate or anything, but it looked good. The planets were whizzing around in reasonably good simulations of their orbits, and you could watch the movement of the whole piece of virtual cosmological clockwork from any point within the system, very roughly. You could watch from Earth, you could watch from Mars, etc., you could watch from the surface of the planet Rupert. Tricia had been quite impressed with herself, but also very impressed with the computer system she was working on. Using a computer workstation on Earth, the task would probably have taken a year or so of programming. When she was finished, the leader came up behind her and watched. He was very pleased and delighted with what she had achieved. "'Good,' he said, "'and now, please, I would like you to demonstrate how to use the system you have just designed to translate the information in this book for me.' Eventually he put a book down in front of her. It was You and Your Planets by Gail Andrews. Tricia stopped the tape again. She was definitely feeling very wobbly indeed. The feeling that she was hallucinating had now receded, but had not left anything any easier or clearer in her head. She pushed her seat back from the editing desk and wondered what to do. Years ago she had left the field of astronomical research because she knew without any doubt whatsoever that she had met a being from another planet, at a party, and she had also known without any doubt whatsoever that she would have made herself a laughing-stock if she had ever said so. But how could she study cosmology and not say anything about the single most important thing she knew about it? She had done the only thing she could do. She had left. Now she worked in television, and the same thing had happened again. She had videotaped—actual videotaped—of the most astounding story in the history of, well, anything. A forgotten outpost of an alien civilization marooned on the outermost planet of our own solar system. She had the story. She had been there. She had seen it. She had the videotape, for God's sake. And if she ever showed it to anybody, she would be a laughing-stock. How could she prove any of this? It wasn't even worth thinking about. The whole thing was a nightmare from virtually any angle she cared to look at it. Her head was beginning to throb. She had some aspirin in her bag. She went out of the little editing-suite to the water-dispenser down the corridor. She took the aspirin and drank several cups of water. The place seemed to be very quiet. Usually there were more people bustling about the place, or at least some people bustling around the place. She popped her head round the door of the editing-suite next to hers, but there was no one there. She had gone rather overboard keeping people out of her own suite. "'Do not disturb,' the notice read. "'Do not even think of entering. I don't care what it is. Go away. I'm busy.' When she went back in she noticed that the message-light on her phone-extension was winking, and wondered how long it had been on. "'Hello,' she said to the receptionist. "'Oh, Miss Macmillan, I'm so glad you called. Everybody's been trying to reach you. Your TV company, they're desperate to reach you. Can you call them?' "'Why didn't you put them through?' said Tricia. "'You said I wasn't to put anybody through for anything. You said I was to deny that you were even here. I didn't know what to do. I came up to give you a message, but—' "'Okay,' said Tricia, cursing herself. She phoned her office. "'Tricia, where the hemorrhaging fuck are you?' At the editing. "'They said—' "'I know. What's up?' "'What's up? Only a bloody alien space-ship!' "'What? Where?' "'Regents Park. Big silver job. Some girl with a bird. She speaks English and throws rocks at people and wants someone to repair her watch. Just get there!' Tricia stared at it. It wasn't a Grebulon ship—not that she was certainly an expert on extraterrestrial craft, but this was a sleek and beautiful silver-and-white thing about the size of a large ocean-going yacht, which is what it most resembled. Next to this the structures of the huge half-dismantled Grebulon ship looked like gun-turrets on a battleship. Gun-turrets. That's what those blank grey buildings had looked like. And what was odd about them was that by the time she passed them again on her way to re-boarding the small Grebulon craft they had moved. These things flitted briefly through her head as she ran from the taxi to meet her camera crew. "'Where's the girl?' she shouted above the noise of helicopters and police sirens. "'There!' shouted the producer, while the sound engineer hurried to clip a radio-mic to her. "'She says her mother and father came from here in some parallel dimension or something like that. And she's got her father's watch, and I don't know—what can I tell you? Basket! Look at what it feels like to be from outer space!' "'Thanks a lot, Ted,' muttered Tricia, checked that her mic was securely clipped, gave the engineer some level, took a deep breath, tossed her hair back, and switched into her role of professional reporter on home ground, ready for anything—at least nearly anything. She turned to look for the girl. That must be her, with the wild hair and wild eyes. The girl turned towards her and stared. "'Mother!' she screamed, and started to hurl rocks at Tricia. "'I'm going to get you, Tricia!' she said, and she threw rocks at the girl. "'I'm going to get you, Tricia!' she said, and she threw rocks at the girl. "'I'm going to get you, Tricia!' she said, and she threw rocks at the girl. "'I'm going to get you, Tricia!' she said, and she threw rocks at the girl. "'I'm going to get you, Tricia!' she said, and she threw rocks at the girl.
 Chapter 4 Tricia began to feel that the world was conspiring against her. She knew that this was a perfectly normal way to feel after an overnight flight going east, when you suddenly have a whole other mysteriously threatening day to deal with, for which you are not in the least bit prepared. But still there were marks on her lawn. She didn't really care about marks on her lawn very much. Marks on her lawn could go and take a running jump as far as she was concerned. It was Saturday morning. She had just got home from New York, feeling tired, crabby and paranoid, and all she wanted to do was to go to bed with the radio on quietly and gradually fall asleep to the sound of Ned Sheeran being terribly clever about something. But Eric Bartlett was not going to let her get away with not making a thorough inspection of the marks. Eric was the old gardener who came in from the village on Saturday mornings to poke around at her garden with a stick. He didn't believe in people coming in from New York first thing in the morning. Didn't hold with it. Went against nature. He believed in virtually everything else, though. "'Probably them space aliens,' he said, bending over and prodding at the edges of the small indentations with his stick. "'There are a lot about space aliens these days. I expect it's them.' "'Do you?' said Tricia, looking furtively at her watch. "'Ten minutes, you reckon. Ten minutes she'd be able to stay standing up. Then she would simply keel over, whether she was in her bedroom or still out here in the garden. That was if she just had to stand. If she also had to nod intelligently and say, Do you? from time to time, it might cut it down to five.' "'Oh, yes,' said Eric. "'They come down here, land on your lawn, and then buzz off again, sometimes with your cat. Mrs Williams at the post office. Her cat. You know the ginger one? It got abducted by space aliens. Of course they brought it back the next day, but it were in a very odd mood. Kept prowling around all morning and then falling asleep in the afternoon. Used to be the other way round, is the point. Sleep in the morning, prowl in the afternoon. Jet lag, you see, from being in an interplanetary craft.' "'I see,' said Tricia. "'They died at Tabby, too,' she says. "'These marks are exactly the sort of marks that their landing-pods would probably make.' "'You don't think it's the lawnmower?' asked Tricia. "'If the marks are more round, I'd say. But these are just off-round, you see, altogether more alien in shape. It's just that you mentioned the lawnmower was playing up and needed fixing, or it might start gouging holes in the lawn.' "'I did say that, Miss Tricia, and I stand by what I said. I'm not saying it's not the lawnmower for definite. I'm just saying what seems to me more likely, given the shapes of the holes. They come in over these trees, you see, in their landing-pods.' "'Eric,' said Tricia patiently. "'Tell you what, though, Miss Tricia,' said Eric, "'I will take a look at the mower like I meant to last week, and I'll leave you to get on with whatever you're wanting to.' "'Thank you, Eric,' said Tricia. "'I'm going to bed now, in fact. Help yourself to anything you want in the kitchen.' "'Thank you, Miss Tricia, and good luck to you,' said Eric. He bent over and picked something up from the lawn. "'There,' he said, "'three-leaf clover. Good luck, you see.' He peered at it closely to check that it was a real three-leaf clover, and not just a regular four-leaf one that one of the leaves had fallen off. "'If I were you, though, I'd watch for signs of alien activity in the area,' he scanned the horizon keenly. "'Particularly from over there in the Henley direction.' "'Thank you, Eric,' said Tricia. "'I'll be back again. I will.' She went to bed and dreamt fitfully of parrots and other birds. In the afternoon she got up and prowled around restlessly, not certain what to do with the rest of the day, or indeed the rest of her life. She spent at least an hour dithering, trying to make up her mind whether to head up into town and go to Stavros for the evening. This was the currently fashionable spot for high-flying media people, and seeing a few friends there might help her ease herself back into the swing of things. She decided at last she would go. It was good, it was fun there. She was very fond of Stavro himself, who was a Greek with a German father. A fairly odd combination. Tricia had been to the Alpha a couple of nights earlier, which was Stavro's original club in New York, now run by his brother Carl, who thought of himself as German with a Greek mother. Stavro would be very happy to be told that Carl was making a bit of a pig's ear of running a New York club, so Tricia would go and make him happy. There was little love loss between Stavro and Carl Mueller. Okay, that's what she would do. She then spent another hour dithering about what to wear. At last she settled on a smart little black dress she had got in New York. She phoned a friend to see who was likely to be at the club that evening, and was told that it was closed this evening for a private wedding party. She thought that trying to live life according to any plan you actually work out is like trying to buy ingredients for a recipe from the supermarket. You get one of those trolleys which simply will not go in the direction you push it, and end up just having to buy completely different stuff. What do you do with it? What do you do with the recipe? She didn't know. Anyway, that night an alien spacecraft landed on her lawn.
 CHAPTER XIII The ship dropped quietly to land on the edge of the wide clearing, a hundred yards or so from the village. It arrived suddenly and unexpectedly, but with a minimum of fuss. One moment it was a perfectly ordinary late afternoon in the early autumn, the leaves were just beginning to turn red and gold, the river was beginning to swell again with the rains from the mountains in the north, the plumage of the picker-birds was beginning to thicken in anticipation of the coming winter frosts, any day now the perfectly normal beasts would start their thunderous migration across the plains, and old Thrashbarg was beginning to mutter to himself as he hobbled his way around the village, a muttering which meant that he was rehearsing and elaborating the stories that he would tell of the past year once the evenings had drawn in and people had no choice but to gather round the fire and listen to him and grumble and say that wasn't how they remembered it. In the next moment there was a space-ship sitting there, gleaming in the warm autumn sun. It hummed for a bit and then stopped. It wasn't a big space-ship. If the villagers had been experts on space-ships they would have known at once that it was a pretty nifty one, a small, sleek, rundy, four-berthed runabout with just about every optional extra in the brochure except advanced vectoid stabilisys, which only wimps went for. You can't get a good tight, sharp curve round a trilateral time-axis with advanced vectoid stabilisys. All right, it's a bit safer, but it makes the handling go all soggy. The villagers didn't know all that, of course. Most of them here on the remote planet of Lamuella had never even seen a space-ship, certainly not one that was all in one piece, and as it shone warmly in the evening light it was just the most extraordinary thing they had come across since the day Kerp caught a fish with a head at both ends. Everybody had fallen silent, whereas a moment before two or three dozen people had been wandering about, chattering, chopping wood, carrying water, teasing the picker-birds, or just amiably trying to stay out of old Threshbog's way. Suddenly all activity died away, and everybody turned to look at the strange object in amazement—or not quite everybody. The picker-birds tended to be amazed by completely different things. A perfectly ordinary leaf lying unexpectedly on a stone would cause them to skitter off in paroxysms of confusion. Sunrise always took them completely by surprise every morning, but the arrival of an alien craft from another world simply failed to engage any part of their attention. They continued to carr and ritt and huck as they pecked for seeds on the ground. The river continued its quiet spacious burbling. Also the noise of loud and tuneless singing from the last hut on the left continued unabated. Suddenly, with a slight click and a hum, a door folded itself outwards and downwards from the space-ship. Then for a minute or two nothing further seemed to happen, other than the loud singing from the last hut on the left, and the thing just sat there. Some of the villagers, particularly the boys, began to edge forward a little bit to have a closer look. Old Threshbog tried to shoo them back. This was exactly the sort of thing that old Threshbog didn't like to have happening. He hadn't foretold it, not even slightly, and even though he would be able to wrestle the whole thing into his continuing story, somehow or other, it really was all getting a bit much to deal with. He strode forward, pushed the boys back, and raised his arms and his ancient knobbly staff into the air. The long warm light of the evening sun caught him nicely. He prepared to welcome whatever gods these were, as if he had been expecting them all along. Still nothing happened. Gradually it became clear that there was some kind of argument going on inside the craft. Time went by, and old Threshbog's arms were beginning to ache. Suddenly the ramp folded itself back up again. That made it easy for Threshbog. They were demons, and he had repulsed them. The reason he hadn't foretold it was that prudence and modesty forbad. Almost immediately a different ramp folded itself out on the other side of the craft from where Threshbog was standing, and two figures at last emerged on it, still arguing with each other and ignoring everybody, even Threshbog, whom they wouldn't even have noticed from where they were standing. Old Threshbog chewed angrily on his beard. To continue to stand there with his arms upraised, to kneel with his head bowed forward and his staff held out pointing at them, to fall backwards as if overcome in some titanic inner struggle, perhaps just to go off to the woods and live in a tree for a year without speaking to anyone. He opted just to drop his arms smartly, as if he had done what he had meant to do. They were really hurting, so he didn't have much choice. He made a small secret sign he had just invented towards the ramp, which had closed, and then made three and a half steps backwards so he could get a good look at whoever these people were, and then decide what to do next. The taller one was a very good-looking woman wearing soft and crumply clothes. Old Threshbog didn't know this, but they were made of rimplon, a new synthetic fabric which was terrific for space travel, because it looked its absolute best when it was all creased and sweaty. The shorter one was a girl, and she was awkward and sullen-looking, and was wearing clothes which looked their absolute worst when they were all creased and sweaty, and what was more, she almost certainly knew it. All eyes watched them, except for the picker-birds, which had their own things to watch. The woman stood and looked around her. She had a purposeful air about her. There was obviously something in particular she wanted, but she didn't know exactly where to find it. She glanced from face to face among the villagers assembled curiously around her, not apparently seeing what she was looking for. Threshbog had no idea how to play this at all, and decided to resort to chanting. He threw back his head and began to wail, but was instantly interrupted by a fresh outbreak of song from the hut of the sandwich-maker, the last one on the left. The woman looked round sharply, and gradually a smile came over her face. Without so much as a glance at old Threshbog, she started to walk towards the hut. There is an art to the business of making sandwiches which it has given to few ever to find the time to explore in depth. It is a simple task, but the opportunities for satisfaction are many and profound—choosing the right bread, for instance. The sandwich-maker had spent many months in daily consultation and experiment with Graup the baker, and eventually they had, between them, created a loaf of exactly the consistency that was dense enough to slice thinly and neatly, while still being light, moist, and having the best of that fine nutty flavour which best enhanced the savour of roast, perfectly normal beast flesh. There was also the geometry of the slice to be refined, the precise relationships between the width and height of the slice, and also its thickness, which would give the proper sense of bulk and weight to the finished sandwich. Here again lightness was a virtue, but so too were firmness, generosity, and that promise of succulence and savour that is the hallmark of a truly intense sandwich experience. The proper tools, of course, were crucial, and many were the days that the sandwich-maker, when not engaged with the baker at his oven, would spend with Strinder the tool-maker, weighing and balancing knives, taking them to the forge and back again. Suppleness, strength, keenness of edge, length and balance were all enthusiastically debated, theories put forward, tested, refined, and many was the evening when the sandwich-maker and the tool-maker could be seen silhouetted against the light of the setting sun and the tool-maker's forge, making slow sweeping movements through the air, trying one knife after another, comparing the weight of this with the balance of another, the suppleness of a third, and the handle-binding of a fourth. Three knives altogether were required. First there was the knife for the slicing of the bread, a firm authoritative blade, which imposed a clear and defining will on a loaf. Then there was the butter-spreading knife, which was a whippy little number, but still with a firm backbone to it. Early versions had been a little too whippy, but now the combination of flexibility with a core of strength was exactly right to achieve the maximum smoothness and grace of spread. The chief amongst the knives, of course, was the carving-knife. This was the knife that would not merely impose its will on the medium through which it moved, as did the bread-knife. It must work with it, be guided by the grain of the meat, to achieve slices of the most exquisite consistency and translucency, that would slide away in filmy folds from the main hunk of meat. The sandwich-maker would then flip each sheet, with the smooth flick of the wrist, on to the beautifully proportioned lower bread-slice, trim it with four deft strokes, and then at last perform the magic that the children of the village so long to gather round and watch with rapt attention and wonder. With just four more dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the trimmings into a perfectly fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the primary slice. For every sandwich the size and shape of the trimmings were different, but the sandwich-maker would always effortlessly and without hesitation assemble them into a pattern which fitted perfectly. A second layer of meat and a second layer of trimmings, and the main act of creation would now be accomplished. The sandwich-maker would pass what he had made to his assistant, who would then add a few slices of newcumber and fladdish and a touch of splagberry sauce, and then apply the topmost layer of bread, and cut the sandwich with the fourth and altogether plainer knife. It is not that these were not also skilful operations, but they were lesser skills to be performed by a dedicated apprentice, who would, one day, when the sandwich-maker finally laid down his tools, take over from him. It was an exalted position, and that apprentice, Drimple, was the envy of his fellows. There were those in the village who were happy chopping wood, those who were content carrying water, but to be the sandwich-maker was very heaven. And so the sandwich-maker sang as he worked. He was using the last of the year's salted meat. It was a little past its best now, but still the rich savour of perfectly normal beast-meat was something unsurpassed in any of the sandwich-maker's previous experience. Next week it was anticipated that the perfectly normal beasts would appear again for their regular migration, whereupon the whole village would once again be plunged into frenetic action, hunting the beasts, killing perhaps six, maybe even seven dozen, of the thousands that thundered past. Then the beasts must be rapidly butchered and cleaned, most of the meat salted to keep it through the winter months, until the return migration in the spring, which would replenish their supplies. The very best of the meat would be roasted straight away for the feast that marked the autumn passage. The celebrations would last for three days of sheer exuberance, dancing, and stories that old Thrashburg would tell of how the hunt had gone—stories that he would have been busy sitting making up in his hut while the rest of the village was out doing the actual hunting. And then the very, very best of the meat would be saved from the feast and delivered cold to the sandwich-maker, and the sandwich-maker would exercise on it the skills that he had brought to them from the gods, and make the exquisite sandwiches of the third season, of which the whole village would partake before beginning the next day to prepare themselves for the rigours of the coming winter. Today he was just making ordinary sandwiches, if such delicacies so lovingly crafted could ever be called ordinary. Today his assistant was away, so the sandwich-maker was applying his own garnish, which he was happy to do. He was happy with just about everything, in fact. He sliced, he sang, he flipped each slice of meat neatly on to a slice of bread, trimmed it, and assembled all the trimmings into their jigsaw. A little salad, a little sauce, another slice of bread, another sandwich, and another verse of Yellow Submarine. Hello, Arthur! The sandwich-maker almost sliced his thumb off. The villagers had watched in consternation as the woman had marched boldly to the hut of the sandwich-maker. The sandwich-maker had been sent to them by Almighty Bob in a burning fiery chariot. This at least was what Thrashbarg said, and Thrashbarg was the authority on these things. So at least Thrashbarg claimed, and Thrashbarg was—and so on and so on. It was hardly worth arguing about. A few villagers wondered why Almighty Bob would send his only-begotten sandwich-maker in a burning fiery chariot, rather than perhaps in one that might have landed quietly without destroying half the forest, filling it with ghosts, and also injuring the sandwich-maker quite badly. Old Thrashbarg said that it was the ineffable will of Bob, and when they asked him what ineffable meant, he said, look it up. This was a problem, because Old Thrashbarg had the only dictionary, and he wouldn't let them borrow it. They asked him why not, and he said that it was not for them to know the will of Almighty Bob, and when they asked him why not again, he said, because he said so. Anyway, somebody sneaked into Old Thrashbarg's hut one day while he was out having a swim, and looked up ineffable. Ineffable apparently meant unknowable, indescribable, unutterable, not to be known or spoken about. So that cleared that up. At least they had got the sandwiches. One day Old Thrashbarg said that Almighty Bob had decreed that he, Thrashbarg, was to have the first pick of the sandwiches. The villagers asked him when this had happened exactly, and Thrashbarg said it had happened yesterday, and they weren't looking. "'Have faith,' Old Thrashbarg said, or burn!' They let him have the first pick of the sandwiches. It seemed easiest. And now this woman had just arrived out of nowhere, and gone straight for the Sandwich-Maker's hut. His fame had obviously spread, though it was hard to know where to, since, according to Old Thrashbarg, there wasn't anywhere else. Anyway, wherever it was she had come from—presumably somewhere ineffable—she was here now, and was in the Sandwich-Maker's hut. Who was she? And who was the strange girl who was hanging around outside the hut moodily, and kicking at stones, and showing every sign of not wanting to be there? It seemed odd that someone should come all the way from somewhere ineffable, in a chariot that was obviously a vast improvement on the burning fiery one which had brought them the Sandwich-Maker, if she didn't even want to be here. They all looked to Thrashbarg, but he was on his knees mumbling, and looking very firmly up into the sky, and not catching anybody else's eye until he had thought of something. "'Trillian,' said the Sandwich-Maker, sucking his bleeding thumb. "'What? Who? When? Where?' "'Exactly the questions I was going to ask you,' said Trillian, looking around Arthur's hut. It was neatly laid out, with his kitchen utensils. There were some fairly basic cupboards and shelves, and a basic corner in the bed. A door at the back of the room led to something that Trillian couldn't see, because the door was closed. "'Nice,' she said, in an inquiring tone of voice. She couldn't quite make out what the set-up was. "'Very nice,' said Arthur. "'Wonderfully nice. I don't know when I've ever been anywhere nicer. I'm happy here. They like me. I make sandwiches for them, and—well, that's it, really. They like me, and I make sandwiches for them.' "'Sounds idyllic,' said Arthur firmly. "'It is. It really is. I don't expect you'd like it very much, but for me it's—well, it's perfect. Look, sit down. Please make yourself comfortable. Can I get you anything? A sandwich?' Trillian picked up a sandwich and looked at it. She sniffed it carefully. "'Try it,' said Arthur. "'It's good.' Trillian took a nibble, then a bite, and munched on it thoughtfully. "'It is good,' she said, looking at it. "'My life's work,' said Arthur, trying to sound proud, and hoping he didn't sound like a complete idiot. He was used to being revered a bit, and was having to go through some unexpected mental gear-changes. "'What's the meat in it?' asked Trillian. "'Ah, yes, that's—that's perfectly normal beast.' "'It's what?' "'Perfectly normal beast. It's a bit like a cow—or rather a bull. Kind of like a buffalo, in fact—large, charging sort of animal.' "'So what's odd about it?' "'Nothing. It's perfectly normal.' "'I see,' said Trillian. "'It's just a bit odd where it comes from,' said Arthur. Trisha frowned and stopped chewing. "'Where does it come from?' she said, with her mouth full. She wasn't going to swallow until she knew. "'Well, it's not just a matter of where it comes from. It's also where it goes to. It's all right. It's perfectly safe to swallow. I've eaten tons of it. It's great. Very succulent, very tender. Slightly sweet flavour, with a long, dark finish.' Trillian still hadn't swallowed. "'Where,' she said, "'does it come from, and where does it go to?' "'They come from a point just slightly to the east of the Hondo Mountains. They're the big ones behind us here. You must have seen them as you came in. And then they sweep in their thousands across the great Anhondo Plains, and—er—well, that's it, really. That's where they come from. That's where they go.' Trillian frowned. There was something she wasn't quite getting about this. "'I probably haven't made it quite clear,' said Arthur. "'When I say they come from a point to the east of the Hondo Mountains, I mean that's where they suddenly appear. Then they sweep across the Anhondo Plains and—well—vanish, really. We have about six days to catch as many of them as we can before they disappear. In the spring they do it again, only the other way round, you see.' Reluctantly Trillian swallowed. It was either that or spit it out, and it did in fact taste pretty good. "'I see,' she said, once she had reassured herself that she didn't seem to be suffering any ill effects. "'And why are they called perfectly normal beasts?' "'Well, I think, because otherwise people might think it was a bit odd. I think old Thrashbarg called them that. He says that they come from where they come from, and they go to where they go to, and that it's Bob's will, and that's all there is to it.' "'Who?' "'Just don't even ask.' "'Well, you look well on it,' said Trillian. "'I feel well. You look well.' "'I'm well. I'm very well.' "'Well, that's good,' said Arthur. "'Yes.' "'Good.' "'Good. Nice of you to drop in.' "'Thanks.' "'Well,' said Arthur, casting around himself. Stunning how hard it was to think of anything to say to someone after all this time. "'I expect you're wondering how I found you,' said Trillian. "'Yes,' said Arthur. I was wondering exactly that. How did you find me?' "'Well, as you may or may not know, I now work for one of the big sub-ether broadcasting networks that—' "'I did know that,' said Arthur, suddenly remembering. Yes, you've done very well. That's terrific. Very exciting. Well done. Must be a lot of fun.' "'That's exhausting. All that rushing around I expect it must be, yes.' "'We have access,' said Trillian, 'to virtually every kind of information. I found your name on the passenger list of the ship that crashed.' Arthur was astonished. "'You mean they knew about the crash?' "'Well, of course they knew,' said Trillian. You don't have a whole space-liner disappear without someone knowing about it.' "'But you mean they knew where it had happened? They knew I'd survived?' "'Yes.' "'But nobody's ever been to look or search or rescue? There's been absolutely nothing?' "'Well, there wouldn't be,' said Trillian. It's a whole complicated insurance thing. You could just bury the whole thing, pretend it never happened. The insurance business is completely screwy now. You know they've reintroduced the death penalty for insurance company directors.' "'Really?' said Arthur. "'No, I didn't. For what offence?' Trillian frowned. "'What do you mean, offence?' "'I see.' Trillian gave Arthur a long look, and then in a new tone of voice said, "'It's time for you to take responsibility, Arthur.' Arthur tried to understand this remark. He found it often took a moment or so before he saw exactly what it was that people were driving at, so he let a moment or two pass at a leisurely rate. Life was so pleasant and relaxed these days there was time to let things sink in. He let it sink in. He still didn't quite understand what she meant, though, so in the end he had to say so. Trillian gave him a cool smile, and then turned back to the door of the hut. "'Random?' she called. "'Come in. Come and meet your father.'
 The same afternoon, Dirk gently awoke also in hospital, suffering from mild concussion, scrapes and bruises, and a broken leg. He had had the greatest difficulty in explaining, on admittance, that most of his injuries had been caused by a small boy and an eagle, and that really being run over by a motorcycle courier was a relatively restful experience, since it mostly involved lying down a lot and not being swooped on every two minutes. He was kept under sedation—in other words, he slept—for most of the morning, suffering terrible dreams in which Torag and a green-eyed, scythe-bearing giant made their escape to the north-east from Valhalla, where they were unexpectedly accosted and consumed by a newly created immense Guilt-God, which had finally escaped from what looked suspiciously like an upturned refrigerator on a skip. He was relieved to be woken at last from this by a cheery, "'Oh, it's you, is it? You nicked my book!' He opened his eyes and was greeted by the sight of Sally Mills, the girl he had been violently accosted by the previous day in the café, for no better reason than that he had, prior to nicking her book, nicked her coffee. "'Well, I'm glad to see you took my advice and came in to have your nose properly attended to,' she said, as she fussed around him. Pretty roundabout way you seem to have taken, but you're here and that's the main thing. You caught up with the girl you were interested in, did you? Oddly enough you are on the very bed that she was in. If you see her again, perhaps you could give her this pizza which she arranged to have delivered before checking herself out. It's all cold now, but the courier did insist that she was very adamant it should be delivered.' "'I don't mind you nicking the book, really, though. I don't know why I buy them, really. They're not very good. Only everyone always does, don't they? Someone told me there's a rumour he entered into a pact with the devil or something. I think that's nonsense, though I did hear another story about him which I much preferred. Apparently he's always having these mysterious deliveries of chickens to his hotel rooms, and no one dares to ask why or even guess what it is he wants them for, because nobody ever sees a single scrap of them again. Well, I met somebody who knows exactly what he wants them for. The somebody I met once had the job of secretly smuggling the chickens straight back out of his rooms again. What Howard Bell gets out of it is a reputation for being a very strange and demonic man, and everybody buys his books. Nice work if you can get it, is what I say. Anyway, I expect you don't want to have me nattering at you all afternoon, and even if you do I've got better things to do. Sister says you'll probably be discharged this evening, so you can go to your own home and sleep in your own bed, which I'm sure you'll much prefer. Anyway, I hope you feel better. Here's a couple of newspapers.' Frank took the papers, glad to be left alone at last. He first turned to see what the Great Zaganza had to say about his day. The Great Zaganza said, "'You are very fat and stupid, and persistently wear a ridiculous hat, which you should be ashamed of.' He grunted slightly to himself about this, and turned to the horoscope in the other paper. It said, "'Today is a day to enjoy home comforts.' "'Yes,' he thought. He would be glad to get back home. He was still strangely relieved about getting rid of his old fridge, and looked forward to enjoying a new phase of fridge ownership, with the spanking new model currently sitting in his kitchen at home. There was the eagle to think about, but he would worry about that later, when he got home. He turned to the front page, to see if there was any interesting news.'
 The stairs were carpeted with a tastefully austere matting type of substance. Dirk quietly made his way up them, passed some tastefully dried large things in a pot that stood on the first landing, and looked into the rooms on the first floor. They, too, were tasteful and dried. The larger of the two bedrooms was the only one that showed any signs of current use. It had clearly been designed to allow the morning light to play on delicately arranged flowers and duvets stuffed with something like hay, but there was a feeling that socks and used shaving heads were instead beginning to gather the room into their grip. There was a distinct absence of anything female in the room, the same sort of absence that a missing picture leaves behind it on a wall. There was an air of tension and of sadness and of things needing to be cleaned out from under the bed. The bathroom, which opened out from it, had a gold disc hung on the wall in front of the lavatory, for sales of 500,000 copies of a record called Hot Potato by a band called Pugilism and the Third Autistic Cuckoo. Dirk had a vague recollection of having read part of an interview with the leader of the band—there were only two of them, and one of them was the leader—in a Sunday paper. He had been asked about their name, and he had said there was an interesting story about it, though it turned out not to be. "'It can mean whatever people want it to mean,' he had added with a shrug from the sofa of his manager's office, somewhere off Oxford Street. Dirk remembered visualizing the journalist nodding politely and writing this down. A vile knot had formed in Dirk's stomach, which he had eventually softened with gin. "'Hot Potato,' thought Dirk. It suddenly occurred to him, looking at the gold disc hanging in its red frame, that the record on which the late Mr. Anstey's head had been perched was obviously this one—'Hot Potato. Don't pick it up.' "'What could that mean?' "'Whatever people wanted it to mean,' Dirk thought with bad grace. The other thing that he remembered now about the interview was that Payne—the leader of Pugilism and the third autistic cuckoo who was called Payne—claimed to have written the lyrics down more or less verbatim from a conversation which he or somebody had overheard in a café or a sauna or an aeroplane or something like that. Dirk wondered how the originators of the conversation would feel to hear their words being repeated in the circumstances in which he had just heard them. "'He peered more closely at the label in the centre of the gold record. At the top of the label it simply said, ARG, while underneath, the actual title, were the writer's credits—Paynton, Mulville, Anstey. Mulville was presumably the member of Pugilism and the third autistic cuckoo who wasn't the leader, and Jeff Anstey's inclusion on the writing credits of a major-selling single was probably what had paid for his house. When Anstey had talked about the contract having something to do with Potato, he had assumed that Dirk knew what he meant, and he—Dirk—had as easily assumed that Anstey was blithering. It was very easy to assume that someone who was talking about green-eyed monsters with scythes was also blithering when he talked about potatoes. Dirk sighed to himself with deep uneasiness. He took a dislike to the neat way the trophy was hanging on the wall, and adjusted it a little so that it hung at a more humane and untidy angle. Doing this caused an envelope to fall out from behind the frame and flutter towards the floor. Dirk tried unsuccessfully to catch it. With an unfit grunt he bent over and picked the thing up. It was a large-ish cream envelope of rich, heavy paper, roughly slit open at one end and resealed with scotch-tape. In fact it looked as if it had been opened and resealed with fresh layers of tape many times—an impression which was borne out by the number of names to which the envelope had in its time been addressed, each successively crossed out and replaced by another. The last name on it was that of Jeff Anstey. At least Dirk assumed that it was the last name, because it was the only one that had not been crossed out, and crossed out heavily. Dirk peered at some of the other names, trying to make them out. Some memory was stirred by a couple of the names which he could just about discern, but he needed to examine the envelope much more closely. He had been meaning to buy himself a magnifying glass ever since he had become a detective, but had never got round to it. He also did not possess a penknife, so reluctantly he decided that the most prudent course was to tuck the envelope away for the moment in one of the deeper recesses of his coat, and examine it later in privacy. He glanced quickly behind the frame of the gold-disc to see if any other goodies might emerge, but was disappointed, and so he quit the bathroom and resumed his exploration of the house. The other bedroom was neat and soulless, unused. A pine bed, a duvet, and an old battered chest of drawers that had been revived by being plunged into a vat of acid were its main features. Dirk pulled the door of it closed behind him, and started to ascend the small wobbly white-painted stairway that led up to an attic room, from which the sounds of Bugs Bunny could be heard. At the top of the stairs was a minute landing, which opened on one side into a bathroom so small that it would best be used by some standing outside and sticking into it whichever limb you wanted to wash. The door to it was kept ajar by a length of green hose-pipe, which trailed from the cold tap of the wash-basin, out of the bathroom, across the landing, and into the only other room here at the top of the house. It was an attic room, with a severely pitched roof, which offered only a few spots where a person of anything approaching average height could stand up. Dirk stood hunched in the doorway and surveyed its contents, nervous of what he might find amongst them. There was a general grunginess about the place. The curtains were closed, and little light made it past them into the room, which was otherwise illuminated only by the flickering glow of an animated rabbit. An unmade bed with dank, screwed-up sheets was pushed under a particularly low angle of the ceiling. Parts of the walls and the more nearly vertical surfaces of the ceiling were covered with pictures crudely cut out of magazines. The hose-pipe curled across the floor, and led around the side of an elderly armchair pulled up in front of the television set. The rabbit rampaged. The glow of his rampagings played on the frayed edges of the armchair. Bugs was wrestling with the controls of an aeroplane which was plunging to the ground. Suddenly he saw a button marked Autopilot and pressed it. A cupboard opened, and a robot pilot clambered out, took one look at the situation, and bailed out. The plane hurtled on towards the ground, but, luckily, ran out of fuel just before reaching it, and so the rabbit was saved. Dirk could also see the top of a head. The hair on this head was dark, matted, and greasy. Dirk watched it for a long, uneasy moment before advancing slowly into the room to see what, if anything, it was attached to. His relief at discovering, as he rounded the armchair, that the head was, after all, attached to a living body, was a little marred by the sight of the living body to which it was attached. Slumped in the armchair was a boy. He was probably about thirteen or fourteen, and although he didn't look ill in any specific physical way, he was definitely not a well person. His hair sagged on his head, his head sagged on his shoulders, and he lay in the armchair in a sort of limp, crumpled way, as if he had been hurled there from a passing train. He was dressed merely in a cheap leather jacket and sleeping bag. Dirk stared at him. Who was he? What was a boy doing here watching television in a house where someone had just been decapitated? Did he know what had happened? Did Gilks know about him? Had Gilks even bothered to come up here? It was, after all, several flights of stairs for a busy policeman with a tricky suicide on his hands. After Dirk had been standing there for twenty seconds or so, the boy's eyes climbed up towards him, failed utterly to acknowledge him in any way at all, and then dropped again and locked back onto the rabbit. Dirk was unused to making quite such a minuscule impact on anybody. He checked to be sure that he did have his huge leather coat and his absurd red hat on, and that he was properly and dramatically silhouetted by the light of the doorway. He felt momentarily deflated, and said, "'Er,' by way of self-introduction. But it didn't get the boy's attention. He didn't like this. The kid was deliberately and maliciously watching television at him. He frowned. There was a kind of steamy tension building in the room, it seemed to Dirk, a kind of difficult hissing quality to the whole air of the place, which he did not know how to respond to. It rose in intensity, and then suddenly ended with an abrupt click, which made Dirk start. The boy unwound himself like a slow, fat snake, leaned sideways over the far side of the arm-chair, and made some elaborate unseen preparations, which clearly involved, as Dirk now realised, an electric kettle. When he resumed his earlier splayed posture, it was with the addition of a plastic pot clutched in his right hand, from which he forked rubbery strands of steaming gunk into his mouth. The rabbit brought his affairs to a conclusion, and gave way to a jeering comedian who wished the viewers to buy a certain brand of lager on the basis of nothing better than his own hardly disinterested say-so. Dirk felt that it was time to make a slightly greater impression on the proceedings than he had so far managed to do. He stepped forward directly into the boy's line of sight. "'Kid,' Dirk said, in a tone that he hoped would sound firm but gentle, and not in any way at all patronising or affected or gauche, I need to know who—' He was distracted at that moment by the sight which met him from the new position in which he was standing. On the other side of the arm-chair there was a large, half-full, catering-sized box of pot-noodles, a large, half-full, catering-sized box of Mars bars, a half-demolished pyramid of cans of soft drink, and the end of the hose-pipe. The hose-pipe ended in a plastic tap-nozzle, and was obviously used for refilling the kettle. Dirk had simply been going to ask the boy who he was, but seen from this angle the family resemblance was unmistakable. He was clearly the son of the lately decapitated Geoffrey Anstey. Perhaps this behaviour was just his way of dealing with shock, or perhaps he really didn't know what had happened. Or perhaps he—Dirk hardly liked to think. In fact, he was finding it hard to think clearly, while the television beside him was, on behalf of a toothpaste-manufacturing company, trying to worry him deeply about some of the things which might be going on in his mouth. "'Okay,' he said, "'I don't like to disturb you at what I know must be a difficult and distressing time for you. But I need to know first of all if you actually realise that this is a difficult and distressing time for you.' "'Nothing.' "'All right,' thought Dirk. ''Time for a little judicious toughness.' He leant back against the wall, stuck his hands in his pockets in an OK-if-that's-the-way-you-want-to-play-it manner, stared moodily at the floor for a few seconds, then swung his head up and let the boy have a hard look right between the eyes. "'I have to tell you, kid,' he said tersely, ''your father's dead.' This might have worked if it hadn't been for a very popular and long-running commercial which started at that moment. It seemed to Dirk to be a particularly astounding example of the genre. The opening sequence showed the angel Lucifer being hurled from heaven into the pit of hell, where he then lay on a burning lake until a passing demon arrived and gave him a can of a fizzy soft drink called Shades, spelt with a small s and a capital H. Lucifer took it and tried it. He greedily guzzled the whole contents of the can, and then turned to camera, slipped on some Porsche-designed sunglasses, said, ''Now we're really cooking,' and lay back basking in the glow of the burning coals being heaped around him. At that point an impossibly deep and growly American voice, which sounded as if it had itself crawled from the pit of hell, or at least from a Soho basement drinking-club, to which it was keen to return as soon as possible to marinate itself into shape for the next voice-over, said, ''Shades, the drink from hell,' and the can revolved a little to obscure the initial s and thus spell Hades. The theology of this seemed a little confused, reflected Dirk, but what was one tiny extra droplet of misinformation in such a raging torrent. Lucifer then mugged at the camera again and said, ''I could really fall for this stuff,' and just in case the viewer had been rendered completely insensate by all these goings-on, the opening shot of Lucifer being hurled from heaven was briefly replayed in order to emphasize the word fall. The boy's attention was entirely captivated by this. Dirk squatted down in between the boy and the screen. ''Listen to me,' he began. The boy craned his neck round to look past Dirk at the screen. He had to redistribute his limbs in the chair in order to be able to do this and continue to fork pot-noodle into himself. ''Listen,' insisted Dirk again. Dirk felt he was beginning to be in serious danger of losing the upper hand in this situation. It wasn't merely that the boy's attention was on the television, it was that nothing else seemed to have any meaning or independent existence for him at all. Dirk was merely a featureless object in the way of the television. The boy seemed to bear him no malice, he merely wished to see past him. ''Look, can we turn this off for a moment,' Dirk said, and he tried not to make it sound so nasty. The boy did not respond. Maybe there was a slight stiffening of the shoulders, maybe it was a shrug. Dirk turned round and was at a loss to find which button to push to turn the television off. The whole control panel seemed to be dedicated to the single purpose of keeping itself turned on. There was no single button marked on or off. Eventually Dirk simply disconnected the set from the power socket on the wall and turned back to the boy, who broke his nose. Dirk felt his septum crunching from the terrific impact at the boy's forehead, as they both toppled heavily backwards against the set, but the noise of the bone breaking, and the noise of his own cry of pain as it broke, was completely obliterated by the howling screams of rage that erupted from the boy's throat. Dirk flailed helplessly to try and protect himself from the fury of the onslaught, but the boy was on top with his elbow in Dirk's eye, his knees pounding first on Dirk's ribcage, then his jaw, and then on Dirk's already traumatised nose, as he scrambled over him to try and reconnect the power to the television. He then settled back comfortably into the armchair, and watched with a moody and unsettled eye as the picture reassembled itself. "'You could at least have waited for the news,' he said in a dull voice. Dirk gaped at him. He sat huddled on the floor, coddling his bleeding nose in his hands, and gaped at the monstrously disinterested creature. "'Move, you creatures! Move, you!' he protested, and then gave up for the time being, while he probed his nose for the damage. There was definitely a wobbly bit that clicked nastily between his fingers, and the whole thing seemed suddenly to be a horribly unfamiliar shape. He fished a handkerchief out of his pocket, and held it up to his face. Blood spread easily through it. He staggered to his feet, brushed aside nonexistent offers of help, stomped out of the room and into the tiny bathroom. There he yanked the hosepipe angrily off the tap, found a towel, soaked it in cold water, and held it to his face for a minute or two, until the flow of blood gradually slowed to a trickle and stopped. He stared at himself in the mirror. His nose was quite definitely leaning at a slightly rakish angle. He tried bravely to shift it, but not bravely enough. It hurt abominably, so he contented himself with dabbing at it a little more with the wet towel, and swearing quietly. Then he stood there for a second or two longer, leaning against the basin, breathing heavily, and practising saying, All right, fiercely into the mirror. It came out as All right, and lacked any real authority. When he felt sufficiently braced, or at least as braced as he was likely to feel in the immediate future, he turned and stalked grimly back into the den of the Beast. The Beast was sitting quietly, absorbing news of some of the exciting and stimulating game-shows that the evening held in store for the determined viewer, and did not look up as Dirk re-entered. Dirk walked briskly over to the window, and drew the curtains sharply back, half hoping that the Beast might shrivel up shrieking if exposed to daylight, but other than wrinkling up its nose it did not react. A dark shadow flapped briefly across the window, but the angle was such that Dirk could not see what caused it. He turned and faced the Boy-Beast. The midday news-bulletin was starting on television, and the Boy seemed somehow a little more open, a little more receptive to the world outside the flickering coloured rectangle. He glanced up at Dirk with a sour, tired look. "'What do you want, anyway?' he said. "'I'll tell you what I wad,' said Dirk fiercely but hopelessly. "'I wad. I got a boobid. I know that faith.'" Dirk's attention had switched suddenly to the television screen, where a rather more up-to-date photograph of the missing airline check-in girl was being shown. "'What are you doing here?' said the Boy. "'Tch!' said Dirk, and perched himself down on the arm of the chair, peering intently at the face on the screen. It had been taken about a year ago, before the girl had learnt about corporate lip-gloss. She had frizzy hair and a frumpy put-upon look. "'Who are you? What's going on?' insisted the Boy. "'Look, shut up!' snapped Dirk. "'I've tried to watch this!' The newscaster said that the police professed themselves to be mystified by the fact that there was no trace of Janice Smith at the scene of the incident. They explained that there was a limit to the number of times they could search the same buildings, and appealed for anyone who might have a clue as to her whereabouts to come forward. "'That's my secretary! That's Miss Pearth!' exclaimed Dirk in astonishment. The Boy was not interested in Dirk's ex-secretary, and gave up trying to attract Dirk's attention. He wriggled out of the sleeping-bag and sloped off to the bathroom. Dirk sat staring at the television, bewildered that he hadn't realised before who the missing girl was. Still, there was no reason why he should have done, he realised. Marriage had changed her name, and this was the first time they had shown a photograph that actually identified her. So far he had taken no real interest in the strange incident at the airport, but now it demanded his attention. The explosion was now officially designated an Act of God. But, thought Dirk, what God, and why? What God would be hanging around Terminal 2 of Heathrow Airport trying to catch the 1537 flight to Oslo? After the miserable lassitude of the last few weeks, he suddenly had a great deal that required his immediate attention. He frowned in deep thought for a few moments, and hardly noticed when the Beast Boy snuck back in, and snuggled back into his sleeping-bag just in time for the advertisements to start. The first one showed how a perfectly ordinary stock-cube could form the natural focus of a normal happy family life. Dirk leapt to his feet, but even as he was about to start questioning the Boy again, his heart sank as he looked at him. The Beast was far away, sunk back in his dark flickering lair, and Dirk did not feel inclined to disturb him again at the moment. He contented himself with barking at the unresponding child that he would be back, and bustled heavily down the stairs, his big leather coat flapping madly behind him. In the hallway he encountered the loathed Gilks once more. What happened to you? said the policeman sharply, catching sight of Dirk's bruised and bulging nose. Only what you told me, said Dirk innocently. I'd beat myself up. Gilks demanded to know what he'd been doing, and Dirk generously explained that there was a witness upstairs with some interesting information to impart. He suggested that Gilks go and have a word with him, but that it would be best if he turned off the television first. Gilks nodded curtly. He started to go up the stairs, but Dirk stopped him. "'Doth anything strike you as strange about this health?' he said. "'What did you say?' said Gilks in irritation. "'Something strange,' said Dirk. "'Something what?' "'Strange,' insisted Dirk. "'Strange? That's right, strange!' Gilks shrugged. "'Like what?' he said. "'It seems to be completely soulless.' "'Completely what?' "'Soulless,' he tried again. "'Soulless. I think that's very interesting.' With that he doffed his hat politely and swept on out of the house and up the street, where an eagle swooped out of the sky at him and came within a whisker of causing him to fall under a seventy-three bus on its way south. For the next twenty minutes hideous yells and screams emanated from the top floor of the house in Lupton Road, and caused much tension among the neighbours. The ambulance took away the upper and lower remains of Mr. Anstey, and also a policeman with a bleeding face. For a short while after this there was quietness. Then another police car drew up outside the house. A lot of Bob's-ear type of remarks floated from the house, as an extremely large and burly policeman heaved himself out of the car and bustled up the steps. A few minutes, and a great deal of screaming and yelling later, he re-emerged also clutching his face, and drove off in deep dungeon, squealing his tyres in a violent and unnecessary manner. Twenty minutes later a van arrived, from which emerged another policeman carrying a tiny pocket television set. He entered the house, and re-emerged a short while later, leading a docile thirteen-year-old boy, who was content with his new toy. Once all policemen had departed, save for the single squad-car which remained parked outside to keep watch on the house, a large, hairy, green-eyed figure emerged from its hiding-place behind one of the molecules in the large basement room. It propped its scythe against one of the hi-fi speakers, dipped a long, gnarled finger in the almost congealed pool of blood that it had collected on the deck of the turntable, smeared the finger across the bottom of a sheet of thick, yellowing paper, and then disappeared off into a dark and hidden other world, whistling a strange and vicious tune, and returning only briefly to collect its scythe.
 Chapter 7 Arthur Dent had been in some hell-holes in his life, but he had never before seen a space-port which had a sign saying, Even travelling despondently is better than arriving here. To welcome visitors the arrivals-hall featured a picture of the President of Nowhat smiling. It was the only picture anybody could find of him, and it had been taken shortly after he had shot himself, so although the photo had been retouched as well as could be managed, the smile at war was rather a ghastly one. The side of his head had been drawn back in in crayon. No replacement had been found for the photograph because no replacement had been found for the President. There was only one ambition that anyone on the planet ever had, and that was to leave. Arthur checked himself in to a small motel on the outskirts of town, and sat glumly on the bed, which was damp, and flipped through the little information brochure, which was also damp. It said that the planet of Nowhat had been named after the opening words of the first settlers to arrive there, after struggling across light-years of space to reach the furthest unexplored outreaches of the galaxy. The main town was called Owell. There weren't any other towns to speak of. Settlement on Nowhat had not been a success, and the sort of people who actually wanted to live on Nowhat were not the sort of people you would want to spend time with. Trading was mentioned in the brochure. The main trade that was carried out was in the skins of the Nowhatian bog-hog, but it wasn't a very successful one, because no one in their right minds would want to buy a Nowhatian bog-hog skin. The trade only hung on by its fingernails because there was always a significant number of people in the galaxy who were not in their right minds. Arthur had felt very uncomfortable looking round at some of the other occupants of the small passenger compartment of the ship. The brochure described some of the history of the planet. Whoever had written it had obviously started out trying to drum up a little enthusiasm for the place by stressing that it wasn't actually cold and wet all the time, but could find little positive to add to this, so the tone of the piece quickly degenerated into savage irony. It talked about the early years of settlement. It said that the major activities pursued on Nowhat were those of catching, skinning, and eating Nowhatian bog-hogs, which were the only extant form of animal life on Nowhat, all others having long ago died of despair. The bog-hogs were tiny, vicious creatures, and the small margin by which they fell short of being completely inedible was the margin by which life on the planet subsisted. So what were the rewards, however small, that made life on Nowhat worth living? Well, there weren't any—not a one. Even making yourself some protective clothing out of bog-hog skins was an exercise in disappointment and futility, since the skins were unaccountably thin and leaky. This caused a lot of puzzle conjecture amongst the settlers. What was the bog-hog's secret of keeping warm? If anyone had ever learnt the language the bog-hogs spoke to each other, they would have discovered that there was no trick—the bog-hogs were as cold and wet as anyone else on the planet. No one had had the slightest desire to learn the language of the bog-hogs for the simple reason that these creatures communicated by biting each other very hard on the thigh. Life on Nowhat being what it was, most of what a bog-hog might have to say about it could easily be signified by these means. Arthur flipped through the brochure till he found what he was looking for. At the back there were a few maps of the planet. They were fairly rough and ready, because they weren't likely to be of much interest to anyone, but they told him what he wanted to know. He didn't recognise it at first, because the maps were the other way up from the way he would have expected, and looked therefore thoroughly unfamiliar. Of course, up and down, north and south, are absolutely arbitrary designations, but we are used to seeing things the way we are used to seeing them, and Arthur had to turn the maps upside down to make sense of them. There was one huge landmass off on the upper left-hand side of the page, which tapered down to a tiny waist, and then ballooned out again like a large comma. On the right-hand side was a collection of large shapes jumbled familiarly together. The outlines were not exactly the same, and Arthur didn't know if this was because the map was so rough, or because the sea-level was high, or because—well, things were just different here. But the evidence was inarguable. This was definitely the earth. Or rather, it most definitely was not. It merely looked a lot like the earth, and occupied the same coordinates in space-time. What coordinates it occupied in probability was anybody's guess. He sighed. This, he realised, was about as close to home as he was likely to get, which meant that he was about as far from home as he could possibly be. Glumly he slapped the brochure shut, and wondered what on earth he was going to do next. He allowed himself a hollow laugh at what he had just thought. He looked at his old watch, and shook it a bit to wind it. It had taken him, according to his own time-scale, a year of hard travelling to get here—a year since the accident in hyperspace in which Fenchurch had completely vanished. One minute she had been sitting there next to him in the slump-jet, the next minute the ship had done a perfectly normal hyperspace-hop, and when he had next looked she was not there. The seat wasn't even warm, her name wasn't even on the passenger-list. The space-line had been wary of him when he had complained. A lot of awkward things happen in space-travel, and a lot of them make a lot of money for lawyers. But when they had asked him what galactic sector he and Fenchurch had been from, and he had said ZZ9, plural Z Alpha, they had relaxed completely in a way that Arthur wasn't at all sure he liked. They even laughed a little, though sympathetically, of course. They pointed to the clause in the ticket-contract which said that any entities whose life-spans had originated in any of the plural zones were advised not to travel in hyperspace, and did so at their own risk. Everybody, they said, knew that. And they tittered slightly and shook their heads. As Arthur had left their offices he found he was trembling slightly. Not only had he lost Fenchurch in the most complete and utter way possible, but he felt that the more time he spent away out in the galaxy the more it seemed that the number of things he didn't know anything about actually increased. Just as he was lost for a moment in these numb memories, a knock came on the door of his motel-room, which then opened immediately. A fat and dishevelled man came in carrying Arthur's one small case. He got as far as, Where shall I put? when there was a sudden violent flurry, and he collapsed heavily against the door, trying to beat off a small and mangy creature that had leapt snarling out of the wet night and buried its teeth into his thigh, even through the thick layers of leather padding he wore there. There was a brief ugly confusion of jabbering and thrashing. The man shouted frantically and pointed. Arthur grabbed a hefty stick that stood next to the door expressly for this purpose, and beat at the bog-hog with it. The bog-hog suddenly disengaged and limped backwards, dazed and forlorn. It turned anxiously in the corner of the room, its tail tucked up right under its back legs, and then stood looking nervously up at Arthur, jerking its head awkwardly and repeatedly to one side. Its jaw seemed to be dislocated. It cried a little and scraped its damp tail across the floor. By the door the fat man with Arthur's suitcase was sitting and cursing, trying to staunch the flow of blood from his thigh. His clothes were already wet from the rain. Arthur stared at the bog-hog, not knowing what to do. The bog-hog looked at him questioningly. It tried to approach him, making mournful little whimpering noises. It moved its jaw painfully. It made a sudden leap for Arthur's thigh, but its dislocated jaw was too weak to get a grip, and it sank whining sadly down to the floor. The fat man jumped to his feet, grabbed the stick, beat the bog-hog's brains into a sticky pulpy mess on the thin carpet, and then stood there breathing heavily, as if daring the animal to move again just once. A single bog-hog eyeball sat looking reproachfully at Arthur from out of the mashed ruins of its head. "'What do you think it was trying to say?' asked Arthur in a small voice. "'Ah, nothing much,' said the man. "'This is its way of trying to be friendly. This is just our way of being friendly back,' he added, gripping the stick. "'When's the next flight out?' asked Arthur. "'Thought you'd only just arrived,' said the man. "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'It was only going to be a brief visit. I just wanted to see if this was the right place or not. Sorry.' "'You mean you're on the wrong planet?' said the man lugubriously. "'Funny how many people say that, especially the people who live here.' He eyed the remains of the bog-hog with a deep ancestral resentment. "'Oh, no,' said Arthur. "'It's the right planet, all right.' He picked up the damp brochure lying on the bed and put it in his pocket. "'It's OK, thanks. I'll take that,' he said, taking his case from the man. He went to the door and looked out into the cold wet night. "'Yes, it's the right planet, all right,' he said again. "'Right planet, wrong universe.' A single bird wheeled in the sky above him as he set off back for the space-port.
 Chapter 10 Ford Prefect hurled himself at the door of the Editor-in-Chief's office, tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave away once again, rolled rapidly across the floor to where the smart grey crushed leather sofa was, and set up his strategic operational base behind it. That, at least, was the plan. Unfortunately the smart grey crushed leather sofa wasn't there. Why, thought Ford, as he twisted himself around in mid-air, lurched, dived and scuttled for cover behind Hile's desk, did people have this stupid obsession with rearranging their office furniture every five minutes? Why, for instance, replace a perfectly serviceable, if rather muted, grey crushed leather sofa with what appeared to be a small tank? And who was the big guy with a mobile rocket launcher on his shoulder? Someone from Head Office? Couldn't be. This was Head Office. At least it was the head office of the Guide, where these Infinitum Enterprises guys came from Zarquandnew. Nowhere very sunny, judging from the slug-like colour and texture of their skins. This is all wrong, thought Ford. People connected with the Guide should come from sunny places. There were several of them, in fact, and all of them seemed to be more heavily armed and armoured than you would normally expect corporate executives to be, even in today's rough-and-tumble business world. He was making a lot of assumptions here, of course. He was assuming that the big bull-necked slug-like guys were in some way connected with the Infinitum Enterprises. But it was a reasonable assumption, and he felt happy about it, because they had logos on their armour-plating which said Infinitum Enterprises on them. He had a nagging suspicion that this was not a business meeting there. He also had a nagging feeling that these slug-like creatures were familiar to him in some way—familiar, but in an unfamiliar guise. Well, he had been in the room for a good two and a half seconds now, and thought it was probably time to start doing something constructive. He could take a hostage. That would be good. Van Haal was in his swivel-chair, looking alarmed, pale, and shaken. He probably had some bad news, as well as a nasty bang to the back of his head. Ford leapt to his feet and made a running grab for him. Under the pretext of getting him into a good solid double-underpinned elbow-lock, Ford managed surreptitiously to slip the identi-ees back into Haal's inner pocket. Bingo. He'd done what he came to do. Now he just had to talk his way out of here. OK, he said. I—he paused. The big guy with the rocket launcher was turning towards Ford Prefect and pointing it at him, which Ford couldn't help feeling was wildly irresponsible behaviour. I—he started again, and then on a sudden impulse decided to duck. There was a deafening roar as flames leapt from the back of the rocket launcher, and a rocket leapt from its front. The rocket hurtled past Ford and hit the large plate-glass window, which billowed outwards in a shower of a million shards under the force of the explosion. Huge shock-waves of noise and air-pressure reverberated around the room, sweeping a couple of chairs, a filing cabinet, and Colin the security robot out of the window. Ah, so they're not totally rocket-proof after all, thought Ford Prefect to himself. Someone should have a word with somebody about that. He disentangled himself from Haal and tried to work out which way to run. He was surrounded. The big guy with the rocket launcher was moving it up into position again for another shot. Ford was completely at a loss for what to do next. Look, he said in a stern voice, but he wasn't certain how far saying things like look in a stern voice was necessarily going to get him, and time was not on his side. What the hell, he thought, hearing a young one so threw himself out of the window. That would at least keep the element of surprise on his side.
 CHAPTER XII Ford tumbled through the open air in a cloud of glass splinters and chair parts. Again he hadn't really thought things through, really, and was just playing it by ear, buying time. At times of major crisis he found it was often quite helpful to have his life flash before his eyes. It gave him a chance to reflect on things, see things in some sort of perspective, and it sometimes furnished him with a vital clue as to what to do next. There was the ground, rushing up to meet him at thirty feet per second per second, but he would, he thought, deal with that problem when he got to it. First things first. Ah, here it came. His childhood. Humdrum stuff, he'd been through it all before. Images flashed by. Boring times on Beetlejuice 5. Xavor Biblebrox as a kid. Yes, he knew all that. He wished he had some kind of fast-forward in his brain. His seventh birthday party, being given his first towel. Come on, come on. He was twisting and turning downwards, the outside air at this height a cold shock to his lungs, trying not to inhale glass. Early voyages to other planets. Oh, for Zark's sake, this is like some sort of bloody travelogue documentary before the main feature. First beginning to work for the Guide. Ah, those were the days. They worked out of a hut on the Buonelli Atoll on Fanala before the Richton Arcles and the Danqueds fertiled it. Half a dozen guys, some towels, a handful of highly sophisticated digital devices, and most importantly a lot of dreams. No, most importantly a lot of Fanala rum. To be completely accurate that old jank spirit was the absolute most important thing, then the Fanala rum, and also some of the beaches on the Atoll where the local girls would hang out. But dreams were important as well. Whatever happened to those? He couldn't quite remember what the dreams were, in fact, but they had seemed immensely important at the time. They had certainly not involved this huge towering office block he was now falling down the side of. All of that had come when some of the original team had started to settle down and get greedy, while he and others had stayed out in the field, researching and hitchhiking, and gradually becoming more and more isolated from the corporate nightmare the Guide had inexorably turned into, and the architectural monstrosity it had come to occupy. Where were the dreams in that? He thought of all the corporate lawyers who occupied half of the building, all the operatives who occupied the lower levels, and all the sub-editors and their secretaries and their secretaries' lawyers and their secretaries' lawyers' secretaries, and, worst of all, the accountants and the marketing department. He had half a mind just to keep on falling, a finger to the lot of them. He was just passing the seventeenth floor now, where the marketing department hung out, a load of tosspots all arguing about what colour the Guide should be, and exercising their infinitely infallible skills of being wise after the event. If any of them had chosen to look out the window at that moment they would have been startled by the sight of Ford Prefect dropping past them to a certain death and flicking the finger at them. Sixteenth floor. Sub-editors. Bastards! What about all that copy of his they'd cut? Fifteen years of research he'd filed from one planet alone, and they'd cut it to two words, mostly harmless. A finger to them as well. Fifteenth floor. Logistical administration, whatever that was about. They all had big cars. That, he thought, was what that was about. Fourteenth floor. Personnel. He had a very shrewd suspicion that it was they who had engineered his fifteen-year exile while the Guide metamorphosed into the corporate monolith—or rather duolith, mustn't forget the lawyers—it had become. He was having to think rather fast at the moment because the situation was becoming a little urgent. He suddenly remembered the floor display panel in the elevator. It hadn't had a thirteenth floor. He thought no more about it because, having spent fifteen years on the rather backward planet Earth where they were superstitious about the number thirteen, he was used to being in buildings that numbered their floors without it. No reason for that here, though. The windows of the thirteenth floor, he could not help noticing as he flashed swiftly by them, were darkened. What was going on in there? He started to remember all the stuff that Harl had been talking about. One new multi-dimensional Guide spread across an infinite number of universes. It had sounded, the way Harl had put it, like wild meaninglessness, dreamed up by the marketing department with the backing of the accountants. If it was any more real than that, then it was a very weird and dangerous idea. Was it real? What was going on behind the darkened windows of the sealed-off thirteenth floor? Ford felt a rising sense of curiosity, and then a rising sense of panic. That was the complete list of rising feelings he had. In every other respect he was falling very rapidly. He really ought to turn his mind to wondering how he's going to get out of this situation alive. He glanced down. A hundred feet or so below him people were milling around, some of them beginning to look up expectantly, clearing a space for him, even temporarily calling off the wonderful and completely fatuous hunt for Wocketts. He would hate to disappoint them, but about two feet below him, he hadn't realized before, was Colin. Colin had obviously been happily dancing attendance and waiting for him to decide what he wanted to do. Colin! Ford bawled. Colin didn't respond. Ford went cold, then he suddenly realized that he hadn't told Colin his name was Colin. Come up here! Ford bawled. Colin bobbed up beside him. Colin was enjoying the ride down immensely and hoped that Ford was too. Colin's world went unexpectedly dark as Ford's towel suddenly enveloped him. Colin immediately felt himself get much, much heavier. He was thrilled and delighted by the challenge that Ford had presented him with, just not sure he could handle it, that was all. The towel slung over Colin. Ford was hanging from the towel, gripping to its seams. Other hitchhikers had seen fit to modify their towels in exotic ways, weaving all kinds of esoteric tools and utilities and even computer equipment into their fabric. Ford was a purist. He liked to keep things simple. He carried a regular towel from a regular domestic soft furnishings shop. It even had a kind of blue and pink floral pattern, despite his repeated attempts to bleach and stonewash it. It had a couple of pieces of wire threaded into it, a bit of flexible writing stick, and also some nutrients soaked into one of the corners of the fabric, so he could suck it in an emergency, but otherwise it was a simple towel you could dry your face on. The only actual modification he had been persuaded by a friend to make to it was to reinforce the seams. Ford gripped the seams like a maniac. They were still descending, but the rate had slowed. "'Up, Colin!' he shouted. "'Nothing.' "'Your name!' shouted Ford. "'Is Colin. So when I shout, "'Up, Colin,' "'I want you, Colin, to go up. OK? Up, Colin!' "'Nothing.' Or rather a sort of muffled groaning sound from Colin. Ford was very anxious. They were descending very slowly now, but Ford was very anxious about the sort of people he could see assembling on the ground beneath them. Friendly local wocket-hunting types were dispersing, and thick, heavy, bull-necked slug-like creatures with rocket launchers were, it seemed, sliding out of what was usually called thin air. Thin air, as all experienced galactic travellers well know, is in fact extremely thick, with multi-dimensional complexities. "'Up!' bellowed Ford again. "'Up, Colin! Go up!' Colin was straining and groaning. They were now more or less stationary in the air. Ford felt as if his fingers were breaking. "'Up!' they stayed put. "'Up! Up! Up!' A slug was preparing to launch a rocket at him. Ford couldn't believe it. He was hanging from a towel in mid-air, and a slug was preparing to fire rockets at him. He was running out of anything he could think of doing, and was beginning to get seriously alarmed. This was the sort of predicament that he usually relied on having the guide available for to give advice, however infuriating or glib, but this was not a moment for reaching into his pocket. The guide seemed to be no longer a friend and ally, but was now itself a source of danger. These were the guide-officers he was hanging outside for Zark's sake, in danger of his life from the people who now appeared to own the thing. What had become of all the dreams he now vaguely remembered having on the Buonelli Atoll? They should have let it all be. They should have stayed there, stayed on the beach, loved good women, lived on fish. He should have known it was all wrong the moment they started hanging grand pianos over the sea-monster pool in the atrium. He began to feel thoroughly wasted and miserable. His fingers were on fire with clenched pain, and his ankle was hurting. "'Oh, thank you, ankle,' he thought to himself bitterly. "'Thank you for bringing up your problems at this time. I expect you'd like a nice warm foot-bath to make you feel better, wouldn't you? Or at least you'd like me to—' He had an idea. The armoured slug had hoisted the rocket-launcher up onto its shoulder. The rocket was presumably designed to hit anything in its path that moved. Ford tried not to sweat, because he could feel his grip on the seams of his towel slipping. With the toe of his good foot he nudged and prized at the heel of the shoe on his hurting foot. "'Go up, damn you!' Ford muttered hopelessly to Colin, who was cheerily straining away, but unable to rise. Ford worked away at the heel of his shoe. He was trying to judge the timing, but there was no point. Just go for it. He only had one shot, and that was it. He had now eased the back of his shoe down off his heel. His twisted ankle felt a little better. Well, that was good, wasn't it? With his other foot he kicked at the heel of the shoe. It slipped off his foot and fell through the air. About half a second later a rocket erupted up from the muzzle of its launcher, encountered the shoe falling through its path, went straight for it, hit it, and exploded with a great sense of satisfaction and achievement. This happened about fifteen feet from the ground. The main force of the explosion was directed downwards, where, a second earlier, there had been a squad of Infinitum Enterprises executives with a rocket launcher standing on an elegant terraced plaza paved with large slabs of lustrous stone cut from the ancient alabaster quarries of Zentalquabula, there was now instead a bit of a pit with nasty bits in it. A great whomp of hot air welled up from the explosion, throwing Ford and Colin violently up into the sky. Ford fought desperately and blindly to hold on, and failed. He turned helplessly upward through the sky, reached the peak of a parabola, paused, and then started to fall again. He fell and fell and fell, and suddenly winded himself badly on Colin, who was still rising. He clasped himself desperately onto the small spherical robot. Colin slewed wildly through the air towards the tower of the guide-offices, trying delightedly to control himself and slow down. The world spanned sickeningly round Ford's head as they spanned and twisted round each other, and then, equally sickeningly, everything suddenly stopped. Ford found himself deposited dizzily on a window-ledge. His towel fell past, and he grabbed at it and caught it. Colin bobbed in the air inches away from him. Ford looked around himself in a bruised, bleeding, and breathless state. The ledge was only about a foot wide, and he was perched precariously on it, thirteen storeys up. Thirteen! He knew they were thirteen storeys up because the windows were dark. He was bitterly upset. He had bought those shoes for some absurd price in a store on the Lower East Side in New York. He had, as a result, written an entire essay on the joys of great footwear, all of which had been jettisoned in the Mostly Harmless debacle. Damn everything! And now one of the shoes was gone. He threw his head back and stared at the sky. It wouldn't be such a grim tragedy if the planet in question hadn't been demolished, which meant that he wouldn't even be able to get another pair. Yes, given the infinite sideways extension of probability there was, of course, an almost infinite multiplicity of planet's earth, but when you came down to it a major pair of shoes wasn't something you could just replace by mucking about in multidimensional space-time. He sighed. Oh well, he had better make the best of it. At least it saved his life for the time being. He was perched on a foot wide ledge, thirteen storeys up the side of the building, and he wasn't at all sure that was worth a good shoe. He stared inwoosily through the darkened glass. It was as dark and silent as the tomb. No, that was a ridiculous thing to think. He had been to some great parties in tombs. Could he detect some movement? He wasn't quite sure. It seemed that he could see some kind of weird flapping shadow. Perhaps it was just blood dribbling over his eyelashes. He wiped it away. Boy, he'd love to have a farm somewhere to keep some sheep. He peered into the window again, trying to make out what the shape was, but he had the feeling, so common in today's universe, that he was looking into some kind of optical illusion, and that his eyes were just playing silly buggers with him. Was there a bird of some kind in there? Was that what they had hidden away up here in a concealed floor behind darkened, rocket-proof glass? Someone's aviary? There was certainly something flapping about in there, but it seemed like not so much a bird, more a sort of bird-shaped hole in space. He closed his eyes, which he'd been wanting to do for a bit anyway. He wondered what the hell to do next. Jump? Climb? He didn't think there was going to be any way of breaking in. OK, the supposedly rocket-proof glass hadn't stood up when it came to it to an actual rocket, but then that had been a rocket that had been fired at very short range from inside, which probably wasn't what the engineers who designed it had had in mind. It didn't mean he was going to be able to break the window here by wrapping his fist in his towel and punching. What the hell, he tried anyway, and hurt his fist. It was just as well he couldn't get a good swing from where he was sitting, or he might have hurt it quite badly. The building had been sturdily reinforced when it was completely rebuilt after the Frogstar attack, and was probably the most heavily armoured publishing company in the business. But there was always, he thought, some weakness in any system designed by a corporate committee. He had already found one of them. The engineers who designed the windows had not been expecting them to be hit by a rocket from short range from the inside, so the window had failed. So what would the engineers not be expecting someone sitting on the ledge outside the window to do? He racked his brains for a moment or so before he got it. The thing they wouldn't be expecting him to do was to be there in the first place. Only an absolute idiot would be sitting where he was, so he was winning already. A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof was to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. He pulled his newly acquired credit card from his pocket, slid it into the crack where the window met the surrounding frame, and did something a rocket would not have been able to do. He wiggled it around a bit. He felt a catch slip. He slid the window open, and almost fell backwards off the ledge, laughing, giving thanks as he did so for the great ventilation and telephone riots of SRDT 3454. The great ventilation and telephone riots of SRDT 3454 had started off as just a lot of hot air. Hot air was, of course, the problem that ventilation was supposed to solve, and generally it had solved the problem reasonably well, up to the point that someone had invented air conditioning, which solved the problem far more throbbingly. And that was all well and good, provided you could stand the noise and the dribbling, until someone else came up with something even sexier and smarter than air conditioning, which was called in-building climate control. Now this was quite something. The major differences from just ordinary air conditioning were that it was thrillingly more expensive, involved a huge amount of sophisticated measuring and regulating equipment, which was far better at knowing moment by moment what kind of air people wanted to breathe than mere people did. It also meant that to be sure that mere people didn't muck up the sophisticated calculations which the system was making on their behalf, all the windows in the buildings were built, sealed, shut. This is true. While the systems were being installed, a number of the people who were going to work in the buildings found themselves having conversations with Bredo Smart systems fitters, which went something like this. But what if we want to have the windows open? You won't want to have the windows open with new Bredo Smart. Yes, but suppose we just wanted to have them open for a little bit. You won't want to have them open even for a little bit. The new Bredo Smart system will see to that. Hmm. Enjoy Bredo Smart. Okay, so what if the Bredo Smart breaks down or goes wrong or something? Aha! One of the smartest features of the Bredo Smart is that it cannot possibly go wrong. So no worries on that score. Enjoy your breathing now and have a nice day. It was, of course, as a result of the great ventilation and telephone riots of SRD T-3454 that all mechanical or electrical or quantum mechanical or hydraulic or even wind, steam or piston driven devices are now required to have a certain legend emblazoned on them somewhere. It doesn't matter how small the object is, the designers of the object have got to find a way of squeezing the legend in somewhere because it is their attention which is being drawn to it rather than necessarily that of the users. The legend is this. The major difference between the thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong, it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair. Major heat waves started to coincide with almost magical precision with major failures of the Bredo Smart systems. To begin with, this merely caused simmering resentment and only a few deaths by asphyxiation. The real horror erupted on the day that three events happened simultaneously. The first event was that Bredo Smart Inc. issued a statement to the effect that best results were achieved by using their systems in temperate climates. The second event was the breakdown of a Bredo Smart system on a particularly hot and humid day with the resulting evacuation of many hundreds of office staff into the street, where they met the third event, which was a rampaging mob of long-distance telephone operators who had got so twisted with having to say all day and every day, thank you for using BSNS, to every single idiot who picked up a phone that they had finally taken to the streets with trash cans, megaphones and rifles. In the ensuing days of carnage, every single window in the city, rocket-proof or not, was smashed, usually to accompanying cries of, get off the line, arsehole, I don't care what number you want, what extension you're calling from, go and stick a firework up your bottom, yee-haw, hoo-hoo-hoo, balloon, squawk, and a variety of other animal noises that they didn't get a chance to practice in the normal line of their work. As a result of this, all telephone operators were granted a constitutional right to say, use BSNS and die at least once an hour when answering the phone, and all office buildings required to have windows that opened, even if only a little bit. Another unexpected result was a dramatic lowering of the suicide rate. All sorts of stressed and rising executives who had been forced during the dark days of the Breathe-O-Smart tyranny to jump in front of trains or stab themselves could now just clamber out onto their own window ledges and leap off at their leisure. What frequently happened, though, was that in the moment or two they had to look around and gather their thoughts, they would suddenly discover that all they really needed was a breath of air and a fresh perspective on things, and maybe also a farm on which they could keep a few sheep. Another completely unlooked-for result was that Ford Prefect, stranded thirteen storeys up a heavily armoured building armed with nothing but a towel and a credit card, was nevertheless able to clamber through a supposedly rocket-proof window to safety. He closed the window neatly after him, having first allowed Colin to follow him through, and then started to look around for this bird thing. The thing he realised about the windows was this. Because they had been converted into openable windows after they had first been designed to be impregnable, they were in fact much less secure than if they had been designed as openable windows in the first place. Hey-ho, it's a funny old life, he was just thinking to himself, when he suddenly realised that the room he had gone to all this trouble to break into was not a very interesting one. He stopped in surprise. Where was the strange flapping shape? Where was the anything that was worth all this palaver, the extraordinary veil of secrecy that seemed to lie over this room, and the equally extraordinary sequence of events that had seemed to conspire to get him into it? The room, like every other room in this building now, was done out in some appallingly tasteful grey. There were a few charts and drawings on the wall. Most of them were meaningless to Ford. But then he came across something that was obviously a mock-up for a poster of some kind. There was a kind of bird-like logo on it, and a slogan which said, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Mark II. The single most astounding thing of any kind ever. Coming soon to a dimension near you. No more information than that. Ford looked round again. Then his attention was gradually drawn to Colin, the absurdly over-happy security robot, who was cowering in a corner of the room, gibbering with what seemed strangely like fear. Odd, thought Ford. He looked round to see what it was that Colin might have been reacting to. Then he saw something that he hadn't noticed before, lying quietly on top of a workbench. It was circular and black, and about the size of a small side-plate. Its top and its bottom were smoothly convex, so that it resembled a small lightweight throwing-discus. Its surfaces seemed to be completely smooth, unbroken, and featureless. It was doing nothing. Then Ford noticed there was something written on it. Strange. There hadn't been anything written on it a moment ago, and now suddenly there was. There just didn't seem to have been any observable transition between the two states. All it said, in small alarming letters, was a single word. PANIC A moment ago there hadn't been any marks or cracks on its surface. Now there were. They were growing. PANIC, the Guide Marked To said. Ford began to do as he was told. He had just remembered why the slug-like creatures looked familiar. Their colour scheme was a kind of corporate grey, but in all other respects they looked exactly like Vogons.
 The only thing which prevented Kate screaming was the sheer pressure of air rushing into her lungs as she hurtled into the sky. When, a few seconds later, the blinding acceleration eased a little, she found she was gulping and choking, her eyes were stinging and streaming to the extent that she could hardly see, and there was hardly a muscle in her body which wasn't gibbering with shock as waves of air pummeled past her, tearing at her hair and clothes and making her knees, knuckles, and teeth batter at each other. She had to struggle with herself to suppress her urge to struggle. On the one hand, she absolutely did not want to be let go of. Insofar as she had any understanding at all of what was happening to her, she knew that she did not want to be let go of. On the other hand, the physical shock of it was facing some stiff competition from her sheer affronted rage at being suddenly hauled into the sky without warning. The result of this was that she struggled rather feebly and was angry at herself for doing so. She ended up clinging to Thor's arm in the most abject and undignified way. The night was dark, and the blessing of this, she supposed, was that she could not see the ground. The lights she had seen dotted here and there in the distance now swung sickeningly away beneath her, but her instincts would not identify them as representing ground. Already the flickering beacons which shone from the insanely turreted building she had glimpsed seconds before this outrage occurred were swaying away behind her now at an increasing distance. They were still ascending. She could not struggle. She could not speak. She could probably, if she tried, bite the stupid brute's arm, but she contented herself with the idea of this rather than the actual deed. The air was bad and rasped in her lungs. Her nose and eyes were streaming, and this made it impossible for her to look forward. When she did try it, just once, she caught a momentary blurred glimpse of the head of the hammer streaking out through the dark air ahead of them, of Thor's arm grasping its stunted handle and being pulled forward by it. His other arm was gripped around her waist. The strength of him defied her imagination, but did not make her any the less angry. She got the feeling that they were now skimming along just beneath the clouds. Every now and then, they would be buffeted by damp clamminess, and breathing would become yet harder and more noxious. The wet air tasted bitter and deadly cold, and her streaming wet hair lashed and slammed around her face. She decided that the cold was definitely going to kill her, and after a while she was convinced that she was beginning to lose consciousness. In fact, she realized, she was actually trying to lose consciousness, but she couldn't. Time slipped into a grayness, though, and she was less aware of how much of it was passing. At last she began to sense that they were slowing, and that they were beginning to curve back downwards. This precipitated fresh waves of nausea and disorientation in her, and she felt that her stomach was being slowly turned through a mangle. The air was, if anything, getting worse. It smelled worse, tasted more acrid, and seemed to be getting a great deal more turbulent. They were definitely slowing now, and the going was becoming more and more difficult. The hammer was clearly pointing downwards now, and finding its way along, rather than surging ahead. Down still further they went, battling through the thickening clouds that swirled around them, till it seemed that they must now reach all the way down to the ground. Their speed had dropped to the point where Kate felt able to look ahead now, though the acridity of the air was such that she was only able to manage a very brief glance. In the moment that she glanced, Thor released the hammer. She couldn't believe it. He released it only for a fraction of a second, just to change his grip on the thing, so that they were now hanging from the shaft as it flew slowly forward, rather than being pulled along by it. As he redistributed his weight into this new posture, he hoisted Kate firmly upwards, as if pulling up a sock. Down they went, and down, further and further. There was now a roaring, crashing sound borne in on them by the wind from up ahead, and suddenly, Thor was running, leaping over rocky, sandy scrubland, dancing through the knotted tussocks, and finally pounding and drumming his feet to a halt. They stood still at last, swaying, but the ground on which they stood was solid. Kate breathed for a few seconds, bending over to catch her breath. She then pulled herself up to a full height, and was about to deliver a full account of her feelings concerning these events at the top of her voice, when she suddenly got an alarming sense of where she was standing. Though the night was dark, the wind whipping at her, and the pungent smell of it, told her that some kind of sea was very close by. The sound of wild, crashing breakers told her that in fact it was more or less beneath her, that they were standing very near to the edge of a cliff. She gripped the arm of the insufferable God who had brought her here, and hoped, vainly, that it hurt him. As her reeling senses began gradually to calm down, she noticed that there was a dim light spreading away before her, and after a while she realized that this was coming off the sea. The whole sea was glowing like an infection. It was rearing itself up in the night, lunging and thrashing in a turmoil of itself, and then smashing itself to pieces in a frenzy of pain against the rocks of the coast. Sea and sky seethed at each other in a poisonous fury. Kate watched it speechlessly, and then became aware of Thor standing at her shoulder. I met you at an airport, he said, his voice breaking up in the wind. I was trying to get home to Norway by plane, he pointed out to sea. I wanted you to see why I couldn't come this way. Where are we? What is this? asked Kate, fearfully. In your world, this is the North Sea, said Thor, and turned away inland again, walking heavily and dragging his hammer behind him. Kate pulled her wet coat close around her and hurried after him. Well, why didn't you just fly home the way we just did, but in, well, in our world? The rage in her had subsided into vague worries about vocabulary. I tried, responded Thor, still walking away. Well, what happened? I don't want to talk about it. What on earth's the point of that? I'm not going to discuss it. Kate shuddered in exasperation. Is this godlike behaviour, she shouted? It bothers you, so you won't talk about it? Thor, Thor, is it you? This last was a thin voice trailing over the wind. Kate peered into the wind. Through the darkness a lantern was bobbing towards them from behind a low rise. Is that you, Thor? A little old lady came into view, holding a lantern above her head, hobbling enthusiastically. I thought that must be your hammer I saw. Welcome, she chirruped. Oh, but you come in dismal times. I was just putting the pot on and thinking of having a cup of something, and then perhaps killing myself. But then I said to myself, just wait a couple of days longer, Tsuliwa, Suwila, Suwili, Tsuliwa and Sis. I can never pronounce my own name properly when I'm talking to myself, and it drives me hopping mad, as I'm sure you can imagine. Such a bright voice I've always maintained, never mind what those others say. So I said to myself, Tsuliwa and Sis, see if anyone else comes along, and if they don't, well, then might be a good time to think about killing myself. And look, now here you are. Oh, but you are welcome, welcome. And I see you've brought a little friend. Are you going to introduce me? Hello, my dear, hello. My name's Tsuliwa and Sis, and I won't be at all offended if you stutter. I, I, I'm a Kate, said Kate, totally flummoxed. Yes, well, I'm sure that'll be all right, said the old woman sharply. Anyway, come along if you're coming. If you're going to hang around here all night, I may as well just get straight on with killing myself now, and let you get your own tea when you're quite ready. Come along. She hurried on ahead, and in a very few yards they reached a terrible kind of ramshackle structure of wood and mud, which looked as if it had become unaccountably stuck while halfway through collapsing. Kate glanced at Thor, hoping to read some kind of reaction from him, to give her a bearing on the situation. He was occupied with his own thoughts, and was clearly not about to share them. There seemed to her to be a difference in the way he moved, though. In the brief experience she had of him, he seemed constantly to be struggling with some internal and constrained anger, and this she felt had lifted, not gone away, just lifted. He stood aside to allow her to enter Tsuliwa and Sis's shack, and brusquely gestured her to go in. He followed, ducking absurdly, a few seconds later, having paused for a moment outside to survey what little could be seen of the surrounding landscape. Inside was tiny. A few boards with straw for a bed, a simmering pot hung over a fire, and a box tucked away in the corner for sitting on. And this is the knife I was thinking of using, you see, said Tsuliwa and Sis fussing around. Just been sharpening it up nicely. You see, it comes up very nice if you get a nice sweeping action with the stone. And I was thinking, here would be a good place. You see, here on the wall I can stick the handle in this crack, hold nice and firm, and then just go fling, and fling myself at it. Fling, you see. I wonder, should it be a little lower? What do you think, my dear? Know about these things, do you?" Kate explained that she did not, and managed to sound reasonably calm about it. Tsuliwa and Sis, said Thor. We have come not to stay, but to— Tsuli, please put the knife down. Tsuliwa and Sis were standing looking at them quite chirply, but she was also holding the knife with its great heavy sweeping blade, poised over her own left wrist. Don't mind me, dears, she said. I'm quite comfortable. I can just pop off any time I'm ready. Happy to. These times are not to live in. Oh, no, you go off and be happy. I won't disturb your happiness with the sound of me screaming. I'll hardly make a sound with the knife as you go. She stood quivering and challenging. Carefully, almost gently, Thor reached out and drew the knife away and out of her shaking hand. The old woman seemed to crumple as it went, and all the performance faded out of her. She sat back in a heap on the box. Thor squatted down in front of her, slowly drew her to him and hugged her. She gradually seemed to come back to life, and eventually pushed him away, telling him not to be so stupid, and then made a bit of a fuss, smoothing out her hopelessly ragged and dirty black dress. When once she had composed herself properly, she turned her attention to Kate and looked her up and down. You're a mortal, dear, aren't you? she said at last. Well, yes, said Kate. I can tell it from your fancy dress. Oh, yes. You want to see what the world looks like from the other side, don't you, dear? What do you think, then? Kate explained that she did not yet know what to think. Thor sat himself down on the floor and lent his big head back against the wall, half closing his eyes. Kate had the sense that he was preparing himself for something. It used to be things were not so different, continued the old woman. It used to be lovely here, you know, all lovely, bit of give and take between us, terrible rows, of course, terrible fights, but really it was all lovely. Now she let out a long and tired sigh and rushed a bit of nothing much off the wall. Oh, things are bad, she said, things are very bad. You see, things get affected by things. Our world affects your world, your world affects our world. Sometimes it is very hard to know exactly what that effect is. Very often it is hard to like it either. Most of them these days are difficult and bad. But our worlds are so nearly the same in so many ways. Where in your world you will have a building, there will be a structure here as well. Maybe it will be a small muddy hillock or a beehive or an abode like this one. Maybe it will be something a little grander, but it will be something. Are you all right, Thor, dear? The Thunder God closed his eyes and nodded. His elbows lay easily across his knees. The ragged strips of Kate's nightgown, bound about his left forearm, were limp and wet. He idly pushed them off. And where there is something that is not properly dealt with in your world, the old lady prattled on, as like as not it will emerge in hours. Nothing disappears, no guilty secret, no unspoken thought. It may be a new and mighty god in our world, or it may just be a gnat, but it will be here. I might add that these days it is more often a gnat than a new and mighty god. Oh, there are so many more gnats and fewer immortal gods than once there were. How can there be fewer immortals? asked Kate. I don't want to be pedantic about it, but... Well, there's being immortal, dear, and then again there's being immortal. I mean, if I could just get this knife properly secured and then work up a really good fling, we'd soon see who was immortal and who wasn't. Sully admonished Thor, who didn't open his eyes to do it. One by one we're going, though. We are, Thor. You're one of the few that care. There's few enough now that haven't succumbed to alcoholism or the onks. What is that, some kind of disease? asked Kate. She was beginning to feel cross again, having been dragged unwillingly from her flat and hurled across the whole of East Anglia on the end of a hammer. She was irritated at being then just abandoned to a conversation with an insanely suicidal old woman, while Thor just sat and looked content with himself, leaving her to make an effort she was not in the mood to make. It's an affliction, dear, which only gods get. It really means that you can't take being a god anymore, which is why only gods get it, you see. I see. In the final stages of it, you simply lie on the ground, and after a while a tree grows out of your head and then it's all over. You rejoin the earth, seep into its bowels, flow through its vital arteries, and eventually emerge as a great pure torrent of water, and as like as not get a lot of chemical waste dumped into you. It's a grim business being a god nowadays, even a dead god. Well, she said, patting her knees. Her eyes hovered on Thor, who had opened his eyes, which was only using them to stare at his own knuckles and fingertips. Well, I hear you have an appointment tonight, Thor. Hmm, grunted Thor, without moving. I hear you've gathered together the great hall for the challenging hour. Is that right? Hmm, said Thor. The challenging hour, hmm. Well, I know that things have not been too good between you and your father for a long time, hmm. Thor wasn't going to be drawn. I thought it was quite dreadful about Wales, continued Sully Wyancis. Don't know why you stood for it. Of course, I realize that he's your father and the All-Father, which makes it difficult, but Odin, Odin, I've known him for so long. You know that he made a deal once to sacrifice one of his own eyes in exchange for wisdom. Of course you do, dear, you're his son, aren't you? Well, what I've always said is he should stand up and make a fuss about that particular deal, demand his eye back. Do you know what I mean by that, Thor? And that terrible tow-rag. There's someone to be careful of, Thor, very careful indeed. Well, I expect I shall hear all about it in the morning, won't I? Thor slid his back up the wall and stood up. He clasped the old woman warmly by the hands and smiled a tight smile, but said nothing. With a slight nod, he gestured to Kate that they were leaving. Since leaving was what she most wanted in all the world to do, she resisted the temptation to say, oh, yeah, and kick up a fuss about being treated like this. Meekly, she bowed a polite farewell to the old woman and made her way out into the murky night. Thor followed her. She folded her arms and said, well, where now? What other great social events have you got in store for me this evening? Thor prowled around a little, examining the ground. He pulled out his hammer and weighed it appreciatively in his hands. He peered out into the night and swung the hammer a couple of times, idly. He swung himself round a couple of times, again, not hard. He loosed the hammer, which bounded off into the night, and split open a casually situated rock a couple of dozen yards away, and then bounded back. He caught it easily, tossed it up into the air, and caught it easily again. Then he turned to her and looked her in the eye for the first time. Would you like to see something? he asked.
 Chapter 1 The history of the galaxy has got a little muddled for a number of reasons, partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have got a little muddled, but also because some very muddling things have been happening anyway. One of the problems has to do with the speed of light, and the difficulties involved in trying to exceed it. You can't. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws. The Hinchfield people of Archentufel Minor did try to build spaceships that were powered by bad news, but they didn't work particularly well, and were so extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there wasn't really any point in being there. So, by and large, the peoples of the galaxy tended to languish in their own local muddles, and the history of the galaxy itself was, for a long time, largely cosmological. Which is not to say that people weren't trying. They'd tried sending off fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in distant parts, but these usually took thousands of years to get anywhere. By the time they eventually arrived, other forms of travel had been discovered, which made use of hyperspace to circumvent the speed of light, so that whatever battles it was that these slower-than-light fleets had been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier, by the time they actually got there. This didn't, of course, deter their crews from wanting to fight the battles anyway. They were trained, they were ready, they'd had a couple of thousand years' sleep, and they'd come a long way to do a tough job, and by Zarkon they were going to do it. This was when the first major muddles of galactic history set in, with battles continually re-erupting centuries after the issues they'd been fought over had supposedly been settled. However, these muddles were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and unravel once time travel was discovered, and battles started pre-erupting hundreds of years before the issues even arose. When the infinite improbability drive arrived and whole planets started unexpectedly turning into banana fruitcake, the great history faculty of the University of Maximegalon finally gave up, closed itself down, and surrendered its buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of Divinity and Water Polo, which had been after them for years. Which is all very well, of course, but it almost certainly means that no one will ever know for sure where, for instance, the Grebulons came from, or exactly what it was they wanted. And this is a pity, because if anybody had known anything about them, it is just possible that a most terrible catastrophe would have been averted, or at least would have had to find a different way to happen. CLICK HUM The huge grey Grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently through the black void. It was travelling at fabulous, breathtaking speed, yet appeared, against the glimmering background of a billion distant stars, to be moving not at all. It was just one dark speck frozen against an infinite granularity of brilliant night. On board the ship everything was as it had been for millennia, deeply dark and silent. CLICK HUM. At least almost everything. CLICK HUM. CLICK HUM. CLICK HUM. CLICK HUM. CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK HUM. A low-level supervising programme woke up a slightly higher-level supervising programme deep in the ship's semisomnal and cyberbrain, and reported to it that whenever it went CLICK all it got was a HUM. The higher-level supervising programme asked it what it was supposed to get, and the low-level supervising programme said that it couldn't remember what it was meant to get exactly, but thought it was probably more of a sort of distant satisfied sigh, wasn't it? It didn't know what this HUM was. CLICK HUM. CLICK HUM. That was all it was getting. The higher-level supervising programme considered this and didn't like it. It asked the low-level supervising programme what exactly it was supervising, and the low-level supervising programme said it couldn't remember that either, just that it was something that was meant to go CLICK sigh every ten years or so, which usually happened without a fail. It had tried to consult its error look-up table, but couldn't find it, which was why it had alerted the higher-level supervising programme of the problem. The higher-level supervising programme went to consult one of its own look-up tables to find out what the low-level supervising programme was meant to be supervising. It couldn't find the look-up table. Odd. It looked again. All it got was an error message. It tried to look up the error message in its error message look-up table and couldn't find that either. It allowed a couple of nanoseconds to go by while it went through all this again. Then it woke up its sector function supervisor. The sector function supervisor hit immediate problems. It called its supervising agent, which hit problems too. Within a few millionths of a second virtual circuits that had lain dormant some for years, some for centuries, were flaring into life throughout the ship. Something somewhere had gone terribly wrong, but none of the supervising programmes could tell what it was. At every level vital instructions were missing, and the instructions about what to do in the event of discovering that vital instructions were missing were also missing. Small modules of software, agents, surged through the logical pathways, grouping, consulting, regrouping. They quickly established that the ship's memory, all the way back to its central mission module, was in tatters. No amount of interrogation could determine what it was that had happened. Even the central mission module itself seemed to be damaged. This made the whole problem very simple to deal with, in fact. Replace the central mission module. There was another one, a backup, an exact duplicate of the original. It had to be physically replaced because, for safety reasons, there was no link whatsoever between the original and its backup. Once the central mission module was replaced, it could itself supervise the reconstruction of the rest of the system in every detail, and all would be well. Robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module from the shielded strongroom where they guarded it to the ship's logic chamber for installation. This involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authenticity of the instructions. At last the robots were satisfied that all procedures were correct. They unpacked the backup central mission module from its storage housing, carried it out of the storage chamber, fell out of the ship, and went spinning off into the void. This provided the first major clue as to what it was that was wrong. Further investigation quickly established what it was that had happened. A meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship. The ship had not previously detected this because the meteorite had neatly knocked out that part of the ship's processing equipment which was supposed to detect if the ship had been hit by a meteorite. The first thing to do was to try to seal up the hole. This turned out to be impossible because the ship's sensors couldn't see that there was a hole, and the supervisors which should have said that the sensors weren't working properly, weren't working properly and kept saying that the sensors were fine. The ship could only deduce the existence of the hole from the fact that the robots had clearly fallen out of it, taking its spare brain, which would have enabled it to see the hole, with them. The ship tried to think intelligently about this, failed, and then blanked out completely for a bit. It didn't realise it had blanked out, of course, because it had blanked out. It was merely surprised to see the stars jump. After the third time the stars jumped, the ship finally realised that it must be blanking out, and that it was time to take some serious decisions. It relaxed. Then it realised it hadn't actually taken the serious decisions yet, and panicked. It blanked out again for a bit. When it had blanked out again, it sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen hole must be. It clearly hadn't got to its destination yet, it thought fitfully, but since it no longer had the faintest idea where its destination was or how to reach it, there seemed to be little point in continuing. It consulted what tiny scraps of instructions it could reconstruct from the tatters of its central mission module.

As far as finding something to land on was concerned, they didn't do very well. The planet they found was desolately cold and lonely, so achingly far from the sun that should warm it that it took all of the Enviroform machinery and life support systems they carried with them to render it or at least enough parts of it habitable. There were better planets nearer in, but the ship's strategiomat was obviously locked into lurk mode and chose the most distant and unobtrusive planet, and furthermore would not be gainsaid by anybody other than the ship's chief strategic officer. Since everybody on the ship had lost their minds, no one knew who the chief strategic officer was or even if he could have been identified, how he was supposed to go about gainsaying the ship's strategiomat. As far as finding something to monitor was concerned, though, they hit solid gold.
 Chapter 11 The first thing Arthur Dent had to do, he realised resignedly, was to get himself a life. This meant he had to find a planet he could have one on. It had to be a planet he could breathe on, where he could stand up and sit down without experiencing gravitational discomfort. It had to be somewhere where the acid levels were low and the plants didn't actually attack you. "'I hate to be anthropic about this,' he said to the strange thing behind the desk at the Resettlement Advice Centre on Pintleton Alpha, "'but I quite like to live somewhere where the people sort of look vaguely like me as well, you know, sort of human.' The strange thing behind the desk waved some of its stranger bits around, and seemed rather taken aback by this. It oozed and glopped off its seat, thrashed its way slowly across the floor, ingested the old metal filing cabinet, and then, with a great belch, excreted the appropriate drawer. It popped out a couple of glistening tentacles from its ear, removed some files from the drawer, sucked the drawer back in, and vomited up the cabinet again. It thrashed its way back across the floor, slimed its way back up onto the seat, and slapped the files on the table. "'See anything you fancy?' it asked. Arthur looked nervously through the grubby and damp pieces of paper. He was definitely in some backwater part of the galaxy here, and somewhere off to the left as far as the universe he knew and recognized was concerned. In the space where his own home should have been there was a rotten hick planet, drowned with rain and inhabited by thugs and boghogs. Even the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy seemed to work only fitfully here, which is why he was reduced to making these sorts of inquiries in these sorts of places. One place he always asked after was Stavromula Beta, but no one had ever heard of such a planet. The available worlds looked pretty grim. They had little to offer him, because he had little to offer them. He had been extremely chastened to realize that although he originally came from a world which had cars and computers and ballet and armagnac, he didn't by himself know how any of it worked. He couldn't do it, left to his own devices, he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich, and that was it. There was not a lot of demand for his services. His heart sank. This surprised him, because he thought it was already about as low as it could possibly be. He closed his eyes for a moment. He so much wanted to be home. He so much wanted his own home world, the actual earth he had grown up on, not to have been demolished. He so much wanted none of this to have happened. He so much wanted that when he opened his eyes again he would be standing on the doorstep of his little cottage in the West Country of England, that the sun would be shining over the green hills, the post-van would be going up the lane, the daffodils would be blooming in his garden, and in the distance the pub would be opening for lunch. He so much wanted to take the newspaper down to the pub and read it over a pint of bitter. He so much wanted to do the crossword. He so much wanted to be able to get completely stuck on Seventeen Across. He opened his eyes. The strange thing was pulsating irritably at him, tapping some kind of pseudopodium on the desk. Arthur shook his head and looked at the next sheet of paper. Grim, he thought, and the next, very grim, and the next. Oh! now that looked better. It was a world called Bartledan. It had oxygen, it had green hills, it even, it seemed, had a renowned literary culture. But the thing that most aroused his interest was a photograph of a small bunch of Bartledanian people, standing around in a village square, smiling pleasantly at the camera. "'Ah!' he said, and held the picture up to the strange thing behind the desk. Its eyes squirmed out on stalks, and rolled up and down the piece of paper, leaving a glistening trail of slime all over it. "'Yes,' it said, with distaste, "'I do look exactly like you.'" Arthur moved to Bartledan, and using some money he had made by selling some toenail clippings and spit to a D.N.A. bank, he bought himself a room in the village featured in the picture. It was pleasant there, the air was balmy, the people looked like him, and seemed not to mind him being there. They didn't attack him with anything. He bought some clothes and a cupboard to put them in. He had got himself a life. Now he had to find a purpose in it. At first he tried to sit and read. But the literature of Bartledan, famed though it was throughout this sector of the galaxy for its subtlety and grace, didn't seem to be able to sustain his interest. The problem was that it wasn't actually about human beings after all. It wasn't about what human beings wanted. The people of Bartledan were remarkably like human beings to look at. But when you said, "'Good evening' to one,' he would tend to look round with a slight sense of surprise, sniff the air, and say that, yes, he supposed that it probably was a goodish evening now that Arthur came to mention it. "'No, what I meant was to wish you a good evening,' Arthur would say, or rather used to say—he soon learned to avoid these conversations—'I mean that I hope you have a good evening,' he would add. More puzzlement. "'Wish?' the Bartledanian would say at last in polite bafflement. "'Ah, yes,' Arthur would then have said. I'm just expressing the hope that—'Hope?' "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'What is hope?' the Bartledanian would say. On the one hand he could only recognise and respect what he learnt about the Bartledanian view of the universe, which was that the universe was what the universe was, take it or leave it. On the other hand he could not help but feel that not to desire anything, not ever to wish or to hope, was just not natural. Natural!—there was a tricky word. He had long ago realised that a lot of things that he had thought of as natural—like buying people presents at Christmas, stopping at red lights, or falling at a rate of thirty-two feet per second per second—were just the habits of his own world, and didn't necessarily work the same way anywhere else. But not to wish! That really couldn't be natural, could it? That would be like not breathing. Breathing was another thing the Bartledanians didn't do, despite all the oxygen in the atmosphere. They just stood there. Occasionally they ran around and played netball and stuff, without ever wishing to win, though, of course. They would just play, and whoever won, won. But they never actually breathed. It was, for some reason, unnecessary. Arthur quickly learned that playing netball with them was just too spooky. Though they looked like humans, and even moved and sounded like humans, they didn't breathe and they didn't wish for things. Breathing and wishing for things, on the other hand, was just about all that Arthur seemed to do all day. Sometimes he would wish for things so much that his breathing would get quite agitated, and he would need to go and have a lie down for a bit. On his own, in his small room, so far from the world which had given birth to him that his brain could not even process the sort of numbers involved without just going limp. He preferred not to think about it. He preferred just to sit and read, or at least he would prefer it if there was anything worth reading. But nobody in Bartledanian stories ever wanted anything, not even a glass of water. Certainly they would fetch one if they were thirsty, but if there wasn't one available they would think no more about it. He had just read an entire book in which the main character had, over the course of a week, done some work in his garden, played a great deal of netball, helped mend a road, fathered a child and his wife, and then unexpectedly died of thirst just before the last chapter. In exasperation Arthur had combed his way back through the book, and in the end had found a passing reference to some problem with the plumbing in Chapter Two, and that was it. So the guy dies. It just happens. It wasn't even the climax of the book, because there wasn't one. The character died about a third of the way through the penultimate chapter of the book, and the rest of it was just more stuff about road-mending. The book just finished dead at the one hundred-thousandth word, because that was how long books were on Bartledan. Arthur threw the book across the room, sold the room, and left. He started to travel with wild abandon, trading in more and more spit, toenails, fingernails, blood, hair—anything that anybody wanted—for tickets. For semen, he discovered, he could travel first class. He settled nowhere, but only existed in the hermetic twilight world of the cabins of hyperspatial starships, eating, drinking, sleeping, watching movies, only stopping at space ports to donate more DNA and catch the next long-haul ship out. He waited and waited for another accident to happen. The trouble with trying to make the right accident happen is that it won't. That is not what accident means. The accident that eventually occurred was not what he had planned at all. The ship he was on blipped in hyperspace, flickered horribly between ninety-seven different points in the galaxy simultaneously, caught the unexpected gravitational pull of an uncharted planet in one of them, became ensnared in its outer atmosphere, and began to fall, screaming and tearing into it. The ship's systems protested all the way down that everything was perfectly normal and under control, but when it went into a final hectic spin, ripped wildly through half a mile of trees, and finally exploded into a seething ball of flame, it became clear that this was not the case. Fire engulfed the forest, boiled into the night, then neatly put itself out, as all unscheduled fires over a certain size are now required to do by law. For a short while afterwards other small fires flared up here and there, as odd pieces of scattered debris exploded quietly in their own time. Then they too died away. Arthur Dent, who because of the sheer boredom of endless interstellar flight was the only one on board who actually had familiarised himself with the ship's safety procedures in case of an unscheduled landing, was the sole survivor. He lay dazed, broken, and bleeding in a sort of fluffy pink plastic cocoon with Have a Nice Day printed in over three thousand different languages all over it. Black, roaring silences swam sickeningly through his shattered mind. He knew with a kind of resigned certainty that he would survive, because he had not yet been to Stavromula Beta. After what seemed an eternity of pain and darkness, he became aware of quiet shapes moving around him.
 By the end of the morning Kate had discharged herself from hospital There were some initial difficulties involved in this because first the ward sister and then the doctor in charge of Kate's case Were adamant that she was in no fit state to leave She'd only just emerged from a minor coma and she needed care. She needed pizza insisted Kate rest She needed my own home and fresh air the air in here is horrible It smells like a vacuum cleaners armpit further medication and should definitely remain under observation for another day or so Until they were satisfied that she had made a full recovery At least they were fairly adamant during the course of the morning Kate demanded and got a telephone and started trying to order pizza To be delivered to her ward. She phoned around all of the least cooperative pizza restaurants She knew in London Her rang them then made some noisily unsuccessful attempts to muster a motorbike to roam around the West End and try and pick up for her an American hot with a list of additional peppers and mushrooms and cheeses Which the controller of the courier service refused even to attempt to remember and after an hour or so of this sort of behavior the objections to Kate discharging herself from the hospital gradually fell away like petals from an autumn rose and So a little after lunchtime she was standing on a bleak West London Street feeling weak and shaky but in charge of herself She had with her the empty tattered remains of the garment bag Which she had refused to relinquish and also a small scrap of paper in her purse which had a single name scribbled on it She held a taxi and sat in the back with her eyes closed most of the way back to her home in Primrose Hill She climbed up the stairs and let herself into her top floor flat There were ten messages on her answering machine, which she simply raised without listening to She threw open the window in her bedroom and for a moment or two leaned out of it at the rather dangerous and awkward angle Which allowed her to see a patch of the park? It was a small corner patch with just a couple of plane trees standing in it The backs of some of the intervening houses framed it or rather Just failed totally to obscure it and made it very personal and private to Kate in a way Which a vast sweeping Vista would not have been on one occasion She had gone to this corner of the park and walked around the invisible perimeter that marked off the limits of what she could see And had come very close to feeling that this was her own domain She had even patted the plane trees in a proprietorial sort of way and had then sat beneath them watching the Sun going down over London Over its badly spoiled skyline and its non-delivering pizza restaurants and had come away with a profound sense of something or other though She wasn't quite certain what still she had told herself these days. She should feel grateful for a profound sense of anything at all however unspecific She hauled herself in from the window left it wide open in spite of the chill of the outside air Padded through into the small bathroom and ran the bath it was a bath of the sprawling Edwardian type which took up a wonderfully disproportionate amount of the space available and Encompassed most of the rest of the room with cream painted pipes The taps seethed as soon as the room was sufficiently full of steam to be warm Kate undressed and then went and opened the large bathroom cupboard She felt faintly embarrassed by the sheer profusion of things you had for putting in baths But she was for some reason Incapable of passing any chemist or herb shop without going in to be subduced by some glass-topped bottle of something blue or green Orange and oily that was supposed to restore the natural balance of some vague substance She didn't even know she was supposed to have in her pores She paused trying to choose something pink something with extra vitamin B vitamin B 12 B 13 Just the number of things with different types of vitamin B in them was an embarrassment of choice in itself There were powders as well as oils tubes of gel even packets of some kind of pungent smelling seed That was meant to be good for some obscure part of you in some arcane way. How about some of the green crystals? One day she had told herself in the past She would not even bother trying to choose but would simply put a bit of everything in when she really felt in need of it She rather thought that today was the day With a sudden reviving rush of pleasure She set about putting a drop or two of everything in the cupboard into the seething bath Until it was confused with mingling muddying colors and verging on the gluttonous to touch She turned off the taps went to a handbag for a moment then returned and lowered herself into the bath Where she lay with her eyes closed breathing slowly for fully three minutes before at last turning her attention to the scrap of paper She had brought with her from the hospital It had one word on it And it was a word she had dragged out of an oddly reluctant young nurse who had taken her temperature that morning Kate had questioned her about the big man the big man whom she had encountered at the airport whose body she had seen in a Nearby side ward in the early hours of the night. Oh, no, the nurse had said he wasn't dead He was just in a sort of coma. Could she see him Kate had asked What was his name? She had tried to ask idly in passing as it were which was a difficult trick to pull off with a thermometer in her mouth And she wasn't at all certain she had succeeded The nurse had said that she couldn't really say she wasn't really meant to talk about other patients And anyway, the man wasn't there anymore. He'd been taken somewhere else They had sent an ambulance to collect him and take him somewhere else. This had taken Kate considerably by surprise Where had they taken him? What was the special place? But the nurse had been unwilling to say anything much more and a second or two later had been summoned away by the system The only word the nurse had said was the one that Kate had then scribbled down on the piece of paper She was now looking at the word was Woodshead now that she was more relaxed She had a feeling that the name was familiar to her in some way Though she could not remember where she had heard it the instant she remembered she could not stay in the bath any longer But got out and made straight for the telephone pausing only briefly to shower all the gunk off her
 Chapter XXIV. Away in the inky depths of space invisible movements were being made, invisible to any of the inhabitants of the strange and temperamental plural zone at the focus of which lay the infinitely multitudinous possibilities of the planet called Earth, but not inconsequential to them. At the very edge of the solar system, hunkered down on a green leatherette sofa, staring fretfully at a range of TV and computer screens, sat a very worried Grebulon leader. He was fiddling with stuff, fiddling with his book on astrology, fiddling with the console of his computer, fiddling with the displays being fed through to him constantly from all of the Grebulon's monitoring devices, all of them focused on the planet Earth. He was distressed. Their mission was to monitor, but to monitor secretly. He was a bit fed up with his mission, to be honest. He was fairly certain that his mission must have been to do more than just sit around watching TV for years on end. They certainly had a lot of other equipment with them that must have had some purpose, if only they hadn't actually lost all trace of their purpose. He needed a sense of purpose in life, which was why he had turned to astrology to fill the yawning gulf that existed in the middle of his mind and soul. That would tell him something, surely. Well, it was telling him something. It was telling him, as far as he could make out, that he was about to have a very bad month, that things were going to go from bad to worse if he didn't get a grip on things and start making some positive moves and think things out for himself. It was true. It was very clear from his star chart, which he had worked out using his astrology book and the computer program which that nice Tricia Macmillan had designed for him to re-triangulate all the appropriate astronomical data. Earth-based astrology had to be entirely recalculated to yield results that were meaningful to the Grebulons here on the tenth planet out on the frozen edges of the solar system. The recalculations showed absolutely clearly and unambiguously that he was going to have a very bad month indeed, starting with to-day. Because to-day Earth was starting to rise into Capricorn, and that, for the Grebulon leader who showed all the character signs of being a classic Taurus, was very bad indeed. Now was the time, his horoscope said, for taking positive actions, making tough decisions, seeing what needed to be done and doing it. This was all very difficult for him, but he knew that nobody ever said that doing tough stuff wasn't tough. The computer was already tracking and predicting the second-by-second location of the planet Earth. He ordered the great grey turrets to swivel. Because all of the Grebulon surveillance equipment was focused on the planet Earth, it failed to spot that there was now another source of data in the solar system. Its chances of accidentally spotting this other source of data, a massive yellow constructor ship, were practically nil. It was as far from the sun as Rupert was, but almost diametrically opposite, almost hidden by the sun. Almost. The massive yellow constructor ship wanted to be able to monitor events on Planet Ten without being spotted itself. It had managed this very successfully. There were all sorts of other ways in which this ship was diametrically opposite to the Grebulons. Its leader, its captain, had a very clear idea of what his purpose was. It was a very simple and plain one, and he had been pursuing it in a simple, plain way for a considerable period of time now. Anyone who knew of his purpose might have said that it was a pointless and ugly one, that it wasn't the sort of purpose that enhanced a life, put a spring in a person's step, made birds sing and flowers bloom. Rather, the reverse, in fact. Absolutely the reverse. It wasn't his job to worry about that, though. It was his job to do his job, which was to do his job. If that led to a certain narrowness of vision and circularity of thought, then it wasn't his job to worry about such things. Any such things that came his way were referred to others, who had, in turn, other people to refer such things to. Many, many light-years from here, indeed from anywhere, lies the grim and long-abandoned planet Vogsphere. Somewhere on a fetid fog-bound mud-bank on this planet there stands, surrounded by the dirty, broken, and empty carapaces of the last few jewelled scuttling-crabs, a small stone monument which marks the place where it is thought the species Vogon vogonblirtus first arose. On the monument there is carved an arrow which points a way into the fog, under which is inscribed in plain, simple letters the words, THE BUCK STOPS THERE. Deep in the bowels of his unsightly yellow ship the Vogon captain grunted as he reached for a slightly faded and dog-eared piece of paper that lay in front of him. A demolition order. If you were to unravel exactly where the captain's job, which was to do his job, which was to do his job, actually began, then it all came down at last to this piece of paper that had been issued to him by his immediate superior long ago. The piece of paper had an instruction on it, and his purpose was to carry out that instruction and put a little tick-mark in the adjacent box when he had carried it out. He had carried out the instruction once before, but a number of troublesome circumstances had prevented him from being able to put the tick in the little box. One of the troublesome circumstances was the plural nature of this galactic sector, where the possible continually interfered with the probable. Simple demolition didn't get you any further than pushing down a bubble under a badly hung strip of wallpaper. Anything you demolished kept on popping up again. That would soon be taken care of. Another was a small bunch of people who continually refused to be where they were supposed to be when they were supposed to be there. That also would soon be taken care of. The third was an irritating and anarchic little device called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That was now well and truly taken care of, and in fact, through the phenomenal power of temporal reverse engineering, it was now itself the agency through which everything else would be taken care of. The Captain had merely come to watch the final act of this drama. He himself did not have to lift a finger. "'Show me,' he said. The shadowy shape of a bird spread its wings and rose into the air near him. Darkness engulfed the bridge. Dim lights danced briefly in the black eyes of the bird as, deep in its instructional address space, bracket after bracket was finally closing, if clauses were finally ending, repeat loops halting, recursive functions calling themselves for the last few times. A brilliant vision lit up in the darkness, a watery blue and green vision, a tube flowing through the air shaped like a chopped up string of sausages. With a flatulent noise of satisfaction, the Vogon Captain sat back to watch.
 New Millennium Audio presents Mostly Harmless by Douglas Adams read by the author
 Cynthia Dracott peered over the balcony at the scene below them with distaste. Valhalla was back in full swing. I hate this, she said. I don't want this going on in my life. You don't have to, my darling, said Clive Dracott quietly from behind her, with his hands on her shoulders. It's all going to be taken care of right now, and it's going to work out just fine. Couldn't be better, in fact. It's just what we wanted. You know you look fantastic in those glasses. They really suit you. I mean really. They're very chic. But, Clive, it was meant to have been taken care of originally. The whole point was that we weren't to be troubled. We could just do it, deal with it, and forget about it. That was the whole point. I've put up with enough shit in my life. I just want it to be good. One hundred percent. I don't want all this. Exactly. And that's why this is so perfect for us. So perfect. Clear breach of contract. We get everything we wanted now, and we're released from all obligations. Perfecto. We come out of it smelling of roses, and we have a life that is just one hundred percent good. One hundred percent. And clean. Just exactly as you wanted it. Really, it couldn't be better for us. Trust me." Cynthia Dracott hugged herself irritably. So what about this new person? Something else we have to deal with? It'll be so easy. So easy. Listen, this is nothing. We either cut him into it, or we cut him right out. It'll be taken care of before we leave here. We'll buy him something, a new coat. Maybe we'll have to buy him a new house. Know what that'll cost us? He gave a charming smile. It's nothing. You won't ever even need to think about it. You won't ever even need to think about not thinking about it. It's that easy. Okay? Hmm. Okay. I'll be right back. He turned and headed back into the antechamber of the Hall of the All-Father, smiling all the way. So, mister—he made a show of looking at the card again—gently, you want to act for these people, do you? These immortal gods, said Dirk. Okay, gods, said Dracott. That's fine. Perhaps you'll do a better job than the manic little hustler I had to deal with the first time out. You know, he's really quite a little character, our Mr. Rag. Mr. Rag. You know, that guy was really quite amazing. He did everything he could, tried every oldest trick in the book to freak me out and give me the runaround. You know how I deal with people like that? Simple. I ignore it. I just ignore it. If he wants to play around and threaten and screech and shovel in five hundred and seventeen sub-clauses that he thinks he's going to catch me out on, that's okay. He's just taking up time. But so what? I've got time. I've got plenty of time for people like Mr. Rag. Because you know what the really crazy thing is? You know what's really crazy? The guy cannot draw up an actual contract to save his life. Really, to save his life. And I tell you something, that's fine by me. He can thrash around and spit all he likes. When he gets tired, I just reel him in. Listen, I draw up contracts in the record business. These guys are just minnows by comparison. They're primitive savages. You've met them. You've dealt with them. They're primitive savages. Well, aren't they? I mean, like the Red Indians. They don't even know what they've got. You know, these people are lucky they didn't meet some real shark. I mean it. You know what America cost? You know what the whole United States of America actually cost? You don't, and neither do I. And shall I tell you why? The sum is so negligible that someone could tell us what it was, and two minutes later we would have forgotten. It would have gone clean out of our minds. Now compared with that, let me tell you, I am providing. I am really providing. A private suite in the Woodshead Hospital, lavish attention, food, sensational quantities of linen, sensational. You could practically buy the United States of America at today's prices for what that's all costing. But you know what? I said, if he wants the linen, let him have the linen. Just let him have it. It's fine. The guy's earned it. He can have all the linen he wants. Just don't fuck with me is all. Now let me tell you, this guy has a nice life. A nice life. And I think that's what we all want, isn't it? A nice life. This guy certainly did, and he didn't know how to have it. None of these guys did. They're just kind of helpless in the modern world. It's kind of tough for them, and I'm just trying to help out. Let me tell you how naive they are, and I mean naive. My wife Cynthia, you've met her, and let me tell you, she is the best. I tell you, my relationship with Cynthia is so good, I don't want to hear about your relationship with your wife, said Dirk. Okay, that's fine. That's absolutely fine. I just think maybe it's worth you getting to know a few things. But whatever you want is fine. Okay. Cynthia's in advertising. You know that. She's a senior partner in a major agency. Major. They did some big campaign, really big, a few years back, in which some actor is playing a god in this commercial. And he's endorsing something, I don't know, a soft drink, you know, tooth rot for kids. And Odin at this time is just a down and out. He's living on the streets. He simply can't get anything together, because he's just not adapted for this world. All that power, but he doesn't know how to make it work for him here, today. Now here's the crazy part. Odin sees this commercial on the television, and he thinks to himself, hey, I could do that. I'm a god. He thinks maybe he could get paid for being in a commercial. And you know what that would be? Pays even less than the United States of America cost. You follow me? Think about it. Odin, the chief and fount of all the power of all the Norse gods, thinks he might be able to get paid for being in a television commercial to sell soft drinks. And this guy, this god, literally goes out and tries to find someone who'll let him be in a television commercial. Pathetically naive, but also greedy. Let's not forget greedy. Anyway, he happens to come to Cynthia's attention. She's just a lowly account executive at the time, doesn't pay any attention, thinks he's just a wacko. But then she gets kind of fascinated by how odd he is, and I get to see him. And you know what? It dawns on us, he's for real. The guy is for real. A real, actual god with a whole panoply of divine powers, and not only a god, but like the main one, the one all the others depend on for their power, and he wants to be in a commercial. Let's just say the word again, shall we? A commercial. The idea was dumbfounding. Didn't the guy know what he had? Didn't he realize what his power could get him? Apparently not. I have to tell you, this was the most astounding moment in our lives. Astounding. Let me tell you, Cynthia and I have always known that we were, well, special people, and that something special would happen to us, and here it was. Something special. But look, we're not greedy. We don't want all that power, all that wealth. And I mean, we're looking at the world here, the whole fucking world. We could own the world if we wanted to, but who wants to own the world? Think of the trouble. We don't even want huge wealth, all those lawyers and accountants to deal with, and I can tell you, I am a lawyer. Okay, so you can hire people to look after your lawyers and accountants for you, but who are those people gonna be? It's more lawyers and accountants. And you know, we don't even want the responsibility for it all. It's too much. So then I have this idea. It's like you buy a big property and then you sell on what you don't want. That way you get what you want, and a lot of other people get what they want, only they get it through you, and they feel a little obligated to you, and they remember who they got it through because they sign a piece of paper which says how obligated they feel to you, and money flows back to pay for our Mr. Odin's very, very, very expensive private medical care. So we don't have much, Mr. Gently. One or two modestly nice houses, one or two modestly nice cars. We have a very nice life. Very, very nice, indeed. We don't need much, because anything we need is always made available to us. It's taken care of. All we demanded, and it was a very reasonable demand in the circumstances, was that we didn't want to know any more about it. We take our modest requirements and we bow out. We want nothing more than absolute peace and absolute quiet and a nice life, because Cynthia sometimes is a little nervous. Okay. And then what happens this morning? Right on our own doorstep. Pow! It's disgusting. I mean, it is really a disgusting little number, and you know how it happened? Here's how it happened. It's our friend Mr. Rag again, and he's trying to be a clever, tricky little voodoo lawyer. It's so pathetic. He has fun trying to waste my time with all his little tricks and games and run-arounds, and then he tries to phase me by presenting me with a bill for his time. That's nothing. It's a... it's work creation. All lawyers do it. Okay, so I say, I'll take your bill. I'll take it. I don't care what it is. You give me your bill, and I'll see it's taken care of. It's okay. So he gives it to me. It's only later I see it's got this tricky kind of subtotal thing in it. So what? He's trying to be clever. He's given me a hot potato. Listen, the record business is full of hot potatoes. You just get them taken care of. There are always people happy to take care of things for you when they want to make their way up the ladder. If they're worthy of their place on the ladder, well, they'll get it taken care of in return. You get a hot potato, you pass it on. I passed it on. Listen, there were a lot of people who were very happy to get things taken care of for me. Hey, you know, it was really funny seeing how far and how fast that particular potato got passed on. That told me a lot about who was bright and who was not. But then it lands up in my back garden, and that's a penalty-clause job, I'm afraid. The Woodshead stuff is a very expensive little number, and I think your clients may have blown it on that particular score. We have the whip-hand here. We can just cancel this whole thing. Believe me, I have everything I could possibly want now. But listen, Mr. Gently, I think you understand my position. We've been pretty frank with each other, and I felt good about that. There are certain sensitivities involved, of course, and I'm also in a position to be able to make a lot of things happen. So perhaps we can come to any one of a number of possible accommodations. Anything you want, Mr. Gently, it can be made to happen." "'Just to see you dead,' Mr. Draycott said Dirk gently. "'Just to see you dead.' "'Well, fuck you, too,' said Mr. Draycott." Dirk gently turned and left the room, and went to tell his new client that he thought they might have a problem.
 Kate rounded on her guest as soon as they were both inside her flat with the door closed, and Kate could be reasonably certain that Neil wasn't going to sneak back out of his flat and lurk disapprovingly half-way up the stairs. The continuing thumping of his bass was at least her guarantee of privacy. "'All right,' she said fiercely. "'So what is the deal with the eagle, then? What is the deal with all the streetlights, huh?' The Norse god of thunder looked at her awkwardly. He had to remove his great-horned helmet, because it was banging against the ceiling and leaving scratch-marks in the plaster. He tucked it under his arm. "'What is the deal,' continued Kate, 'with the Coca-Cola machine? What is the deal with the hammer? What, in short, is the big deal, huh?' Thor said nothing. He frowned for a second in arrogant irritation, then frowned in something that looked somewhat like embarrassment, and then simply stood there and bled at her. For a few seconds she resisted the impending internal collapse of her attitude, and then realised it was just going to hell anyway, so she might as well get on with it. "'Okay,' she muttered. Let's get all that cleaned up. I'll find some antiseptic.' She went to rummage in the kitchen cupboard, and returned with a bottle, to find Thor saying no at her. "'No what?' she said crossly, putting the bottle down on the table with a bit of a bang. 'That,' said Thor, and pushed the bottle back at her. "'No.' "'What's the matter with it?' Thor just shrugged and stared moodily at a corner of the room. There was nothing that could be considered remotely interesting in that corner of the room, so he was clearly looking at it out of sheer bloody-mindedness. "'Look, Buster,' said Kate. "'If I can call you Buster. What—' "'Thor,' said Thor. "'God of—' "'Yes,' said Kate. You've told me all the things you're a god of. I'm trying to clean up your arm.' "'Cedra,' said Thor, holding his bleeding arm out, but away from her. He peered at it anxiously. "'What?' "'Crushed leaves of cedra. Oil of the kernel of the apricot. Infusion of bitter orange blossom. Oil of almonds, sage and comfrey. Not this.' He pushed the bottle of antiseptic off the table and sank into a mood. "'Right,' said Kate, picked up the bottle and hurled it at him. It rebounded off his cheekbone, leaving an instant red mark. Thor lunged forward in a rage, but Kate simply stood her ground when the finger pointed at him. "'You stay right there, Buster,' she said, and he stopped. "'Anything special you need for that?' Thor looked puzzled for a moment. "'That,' said Kate, pointing at the blossoming bruise on his cheek. "'Vengeance,' said Thor. "'I have to see what I can do,' said Kate. She turned on her heel and stalked out of the room. After about two minutes of unseen activity, Kate returned to the room, trailed by wisps of steam. "'All right,' she said. "'Come with me.' She led him into her bathroom. He followed her with a great show of reluctance, but he followed her. Kate had been trailed by wisps of steam because the bathroom was full of it. The bath itself was overflowing with bubbles and gunk. There were some bottles and pots, mostly empty, lined up along a small shelf above the bath. Kate picked them up one by one and displayed them at him. "'Apricot kernel oil,' she said, and turned it upside down to emphasize his emptiness. "'All in there,' she added, pointing at the foaming bath. "'Neroli oil,' she said, picking up the next one. "'Distilled from the blossom of bitter oranges. All in there.' She picked up the next one. "'Orange cream bath oil. Contains almond oil. All in there.' She picked up the pots. "'Sage and comfrey,' she said of one, and cedra oil. One of them's a hand cream and the other's hair conditioner, but they're all in there, along with a tube of aloe lip preserver, some cucumber cleansing milk, honeyed beeswax and jojoba oil cleanser, rasoul mud, seaweed and birch shampoo, rich night cream with vitamin E, and a very great deal of cod liver oil. I'm afraid I haven't got anything called vengeance, but here's some Calvin Klein obsession.' She took the stopper from a bottle of perfume and threw the bottle in the bath. "'I'll be in the next room when you're done.' With that she marched out and slammed the door on him. She waited in the other room, firmly reading a book.
 Chapter 18 Arthur leapt to his feet with a start of fear. It would be hard to say which he was more frightened of—that he might have hurt the person he had inadvertently sat on, or that the person he had inadvertently sat on would hurt him back. There seemed, on inspection, to be little immediate cause for alarm on the second count. Whoever it was he had sat on was unconscious. That will probably go a great deal of the way towards explaining what he was doing lying there. He seemed to be breathing OK, though. Arthur felt his pulse. That was OK as well. He was lying on his side, half curled up. It was so long ago and far away when Arthur had last done first aid that he couldn't really remember what it was he was supposed to do. The first thing he was supposed to do, he remembered, was to have a first-aid kit about his person. Damn! Should he roll him on his back or not? Suppose he had any broken bones? Suppose he swallowed his tongue? Suppose he sued him? Who apart from anything else was he? At that moment the unconscious man groaned loudly and rolled himself over. Arthur wondered if he should—he looked at him. He looked at him again. He looked at him again just to make absolutely sure. Despite the fact that he had been thinking he was feeling about as low as he possibly could, he experienced a terrible sinking feeling. The figure groaned again and slowly opened his eyes. It took him a while to focus. Then he blinked and stiffened. You—' said Ford Prefect. You—' said Arthur Dent. Ford groaned again. What do you need have explained this time? he said, and closed his eyes in some kind of despair. Five minutes later he was sitting up and rubbing the side of his head, where he had quite a large swelling. Who the hell was that woman? he said. Why are we surrounded by squirrels, and what do they want? I've been pestered by squirrels all night, said Arthur. They keep on trying to give me magazines and stuff. Ford frowned. Really? he said. And bits of rag, Ford thought. Oh! he said. Is this near where your ship crashed? Yes, said Arthur. He said it a little tightly. That's probably it, said Ford. Can happen. Ship's cabin robots get destroyed. The cyber-minds that control them survive and start infesting the local wildlife. Can turn a whole ecosystem into some kind of helpless thrashing service industry, handing out hot towels and drinks to passers-by. Should be a law against it. Probably is. Probably also a law against there being a law against it, so everybody can get nice and worked up. Hey-ho! What did you say? I said, said Arthur, and the woman is my daughter. Ford stopped rubbing his head. Say that one more time. I said, said Arthur huffily, the woman is my daughter. I didn't know, said Ford, that you had a daughter. Well, there's probably a lot you don't know about me, said Arthur. Come to mention it, there's probably a lot I don't know about me either. Well, well, well, said Ford. When did this happen? I'm not quite sure. Well, that sounds like more familiar territory, said Ford. Is there a mother involved? Trillion, said Arthur. Trillion! I didn't think that— No. Look, it's a bit embarrassing. I remember she told me once she had a kid, said Ford, but only sort of in passing. I'm in touch with her from time to time. Never seen her with the kid. Arthur said nothing. Ford started to feel the side of his head again in some bemusement. Are you sure this was your daughter? he said. Tell me what happened, said Arthur. Pfft! Long story. I was coming to pick up this parcel I'd sent myself here, care of you. Well, what was all that about? said Arthur. I think it may be something unimaginably dangerous. And you sent it to me? protested Arthur. I thought I could rely on you to be absolutely boring and not open it. Anyway, coming in at night I couldn't find this village place. I was going by pretty basic information. I couldn't find any signal of any kind. I guess you don't have signals and stuff here. That's what I like about it, said Arthur. Then I did pick up a faint signal from your old copy of the guide, so I homed in on that, thinking that would take me to you. I found I'd landed in some kind of wood, couldn't figure out what was going on. I get out and then see this woman standing there. I go up to say hello, then suddenly see that she's got this thing. What thing, said Arthur? The thing I sent you, the new guide, the bird thing. You were meant to keep it safe, you idiot, but this woman had the thing right there by her shoulder. I ran forward and she hit me with a rock. I see, said Arthur. What did you do? Well, I fell over, of course. I was very badly hurt. She and the bird started to make off towards my ship, and when I say my ship, I mean an RW6. A what? An RW6, for zark's sake. I've got this great relationship going now between my credit card and the guide's central computer. You would not believe that ship, Arthur. It's... So an RW6 is a spaceship, then? Yes, it's... Oh, never mind. Look, just get some kind of grip, will you, Arthur, or at least get some kind of catalogue. At this point I was very worried, and I think semi-concussed. I was down on my knees and breathing profusely, so I did the only thing I could think of, which was to beg. I said, please, for zark's sake, don't take my ship, and don't leave me stranded in the middle of some primitive zarking forest with no medical help and a head injury. I could be in serious trouble, and so could she. What did she say? She hit me on the head with a rock again. I think I can confirm that that was my daughter. Ah, sweet kid! You have to get to know her, said Arthur. Oh, she eases up, does she? No, said Arthur, but you get a better sense of when to duck. Ford held his head and tried to see straight. The sky was beginning to lighten in the west, which is where the sun rose. Arthur didn't particularly want to see it. The last thing he wanted after a hellish night like this one was some blasted day coming along and barging about the place. What are you doing in a place like this, Arthur? demanded Ford. Well, said Arthur, making sandwiches, mostly. What? I am—probably was—the sandwich-maker for a small tribe. It was a bit embarrassing, really. When I first arrived—that is, when they rescued me from the wreckage of the super-high-technology spacecraft which had crashed on their planet—they were very nice to me, and I thought I should help them out a bit. You know, I'm an educated chap from a high-technology culture. I could show them a thing or two. And of course I couldn't. I haven't got the faintest idea when it comes down to it of how anything actually works. I don't mean like video-recorders—nobody knows how to work those—I mean just something like a pen or an artesian wheel or something. Not the foggiest. I couldn't help at all. One day I got glum and made myself a sandwich. That suddenly got them all excited. They'd never seen one before. It was just an idea that had never occurred to them, and I happened to quite like making sandwiches, so it all sort of developed from there. And you enjoyed that? said Ford. Well, yes, I think I sort of did, really. Getting a good set of knives, you know, that sort of thing. You didn't, for instance, said Ford, find it mind-witheringly, explosively, astoundingly, blisteringly dull? Well, no, not as such. Not actually blisteringly. Odd. I would, said Ford. Well, I suppose we have a different outlook. Yes. Like the picker-birds. Ford had no idea what he was talking about, and couldn't be bothered to ask. Instead he said, So how the hell do we get out of this place? Well, I think the simplest way from here is just to follow the way down the valley to the plains, probably take an hour, and then walk around from there. I don't think I could face going back up and over the way I came. Walk around where from there? Well, back to the village, I suppose. Arthur sighed a little forlornly. I don't want to go to any blasted village, snapped Ford. We've got to get out of here. Where? How? said Arthur. I don't know. You tell me. You live here. There must be some way out of this zarking planet. I don't know, said Arthur. What do you usually do? Sit around and wait for a passing spacecraft, I suppose? Oh, yes. And how many spacecraft have visited the zark-forsaken little flea-pit recently? Well, a few years ago there was mine that crashed here by mistake, then there was a trillion, then the parcel delivery, and now you, and— Yes, but apart from the usual suspects. Well, I think pretty much none, so far as I know. Pretty quiet around here. As if deliberately to prove him wrong, there was a long, low, distant roll of thunder. Ford leapt to his feet fretfully, and started pacing backwards and forwards in the feeble, painful light of the early dawn, which lay streaked across the sky as if someone had dragged a piece of liver across it. You don't understand how important this is, he said. What? You mean my daughter out there all alone in the galaxy? You think I don't— Can we feel sorry for the galaxy later, said Ford. This is very, very serious indeed. The guide has been taken over. It's been bought out. Arthur leapt up. Oh, very serious, he shouted. Please fill me in straight away on some corporate publishing politics. Can't tell you how much has been on my mind of late. You don't understand, said Ford. There's a whole new guide. Oh, shouted Arthur again. Oh, oh, oh, I'm incoherent with excitement. I can hardly wait for it to come out to find out which of the most exciting spaceports to get bored hanging about in in some globular cluster I've never heard of. Please can we rush to a store that's got it right this very instant? Ford narrowed his eyes. This is that thing you call sarcasm, isn't it? Do you know, bellowed Arthur, I think it is. I really think it might just be a crazy little thing called sarcasm seeping in at the edges of my manner of speech. Ford, I have had a fucking bad night. Will you please try and take that into account while you consider what fascinating bits of badger-sputumly inconsequential trivia to assail me with next? Try to rest, said Ford. I need to think. Why do you need to think? Can't we just sit and go blub blub blub blub with our lips for a bit? Couldn't we just dribble gently and loll a little bit to the left for a few minutes? I can't stand it, Ford. I can't stand all this thinking and trying to work things out anymore. You may think that I'm just standing here barking. Hadn't occurred to me, in fact. I mean it. What is the point? We assume that every time we do anything we know what the consequences will be, i.e. more or less what we intend them to be. This is not only not always correct, it is wildly, crazily, stupidly, cross-eyed, blithering, insectly wrong. Which is exactly my point, said Ford. Thank you, said Arthur, sitting down again. What? Temporal reverse engineering. Arthur put his head in his hands and shook it gently from side to side. Is there any humane way, he moaned, in which I can prevent you from telling me what temporary reverse bloody Watsitting is? No, said Ford, because your daughter is caught up in the middle of it, and it is deadly, deadly serious. Thunder rolled in the pause. All right, said Arthur, tell me. I leapt out of a high-rise office window, said Ford. This cheered Arthur up. Oh, he said, why don't you do it again? I did. Hmm, said Arthur, disappointed. Obviously no good came of it. The first time, said Ford, I managed to save myself by the most astonishing and—I say this in all modesty—fabulous piece of ingenious quick-thinking agility, fancy footwork and self-sacrifice. What was a self-sacrifice, said Arthur? I jettisoned half of a much-loved and, I think, irreplaceable pair of shoes. Why was that self-sacrifice? Because they were mine, said Ford, crossly. I think we have different value systems, said Arthur. Well, mine's better, said Ford. Well, that's according to your—oh, never mind. So, having saved yourself very cleverly once, you very sensibly went and jumped again. Please don't tell me why. Just tell me what happened, if you must. I fell straight into the open cockpit of a passing jet town-car, whose pilot had just accidentally pushed the eject button, when he meant only to change tracks on the stereo. Now, even I couldn't think that that was particularly clever of me. No, I don't know, said Arthur, wearily. I expect he had probably sneaked into his jet-car the previous night and set the pilot's least favourite track to play, or something. No, I didn't, said Ford. Just checking. Though, oddly enough, somebody else did. And this is the nub. You could trace the chain and branches of crucial events and coincidences back and back. Turned out the new guide had done it. That bird. What bird, said Arthur? You haven't seen it? No. Oh, it's a lethal little thing. Looks pretty, talks big, collapses waveforms selectively at will. What does that mean? Temporal reverse engineering. Oh, said Arthur. Oh, yes. The question is, who is it really doing it for? I've actually got a sandwich in my pocket, said Arthur, delving. Would you like a bit? Yeah, OK. It's a bit squished and sodden, I'm afraid. Never mind. They munched for a bit. It's quite good, in fact, said Ford. What's the meat in it? Perfectly normal beast, said Arthur. Oh, not come across that one. So the question is, Ford continued, who is the bird really doing it for? What's the real game here? Mm-mm, ate Arthur. Well, I found the bird, continued Ford, which I did by a series of coincidences that are interesting in themselves. It put on the most fantastic multidimensional display of pyrotechnics I've ever seen. It then said that it would put its services at my disposal in my universe. I said thanks, but no thanks. It said that it would do it anyway, whether I liked it or not. I said just try it, and it said that it would, and indeed already had done. I said we'd see about that, and it said that we would. That's why I decided to pack the thing up and get it out of there. So I sent it to you for safety. Oh, yes, said Arthur. Whose? Never you mind, said Ford. Then, what with one thing or another, I thought it prudent to jump out of the window again, being fresh out of other options at the time. Luckily for me the jet-car was there, otherwise I would have had to fall back on ingenious quick-thinking agility, maybe another shoe or failing all else, the ground. But it meant that, whether I liked it or not, the guide was, well, working for me, and that was deeply worrying. Why? Because if you've got the guide you think that you are the one it's working for. Everything went swimmingly smoothly for me from then on, up to the very moment that I came up against the totty with the rock. Then, bang, I'm history, I'm out of the loop. Are you referring to my daughter? As politely as I can, said Ford. She's the next one in the chain who will think that everything is going fabulously for her. She can beat whoever she likes around the head with bits of the landscape. Everything will just swim for her until she's done whatever she's supposed to do, and then it'll be all up for her too. I was in the middle of some adverse temporal engineering, and clearly nobody understood what was being unleashed. Like me, for instance, said Arthur. What? Oh, wake up, Arthur. Look, let me try it again. The new guide came out of the research labs. It made use of this new technology of unfiltered perception. Do you know what that means? Look, I've been making sandwiches for Bob's sake, said Arthur. Who's Bob? Never mind, just carry on. Filtered perception, said Ford, means it perceives everything. Got that? I don't perceive everything. You don't perceive everything. We have filters. The new guide doesn't have any sense filters. It perceives everything. It wasn't a complicated technological idea. It was just a question of leaving a bit out. Got it? Why don't I just say that I've got it, said Arthur, and then you can carry on regardless. Right. Now, because the bird can perceive every possible universe, it is present in every possible universe, yes? Yes-ish. So what happens is the bozos in the marketing and accounting departments say, oh, that sounds good. Doesn't that mean we only have to make one of them and then sell it an infinite number of times? Don't squint at me like that, Arthur. This is how accountants think. Well, it's quite clever, isn't it? No, it's fantastically stupid. Look, the machine's only a little guide. It's got some quite clever cyber technology in it, but because it has unfiltered perception, any smallest move it makes has the power of a virus. It can propagate throughout space, time, and a million other dimensions. Anything can be focused anywhere in any of the universes that you and I move in. Its power is recursive. Think of a computer program. Somewhere there is one key instruction, and everything else is just functions calling themselves or brackets billowing out endlessly through an infinite address space. What happens when the brackets collapse? What's the final end if? Is any of this making sense, Arthur? Sorry, I was nodding off for a moment. Something about the universe, yes? Something about the universe, yes, said Ford wearily. He sat down again. All right, he said, think about this. You know who I think I saw at the guide office's? Vogons. Ah, I see I've said a word you understand at last. Arthur leapt to his feet. That noise, he said. What noise? The thunder. The thunder. What about it? It isn't thunder. It's the spring migration of the perfectly normal beasts. It's started. What are these animals you keep on about? I don't keep on about them. I just put bits of them in sandwiches. Why are they called perfectly normal beasts, said Ford. Arthur told him. It wasn't often that Arthur had the pleasure of seeing Ford's eyes open wide with astonishment.
 Chapter XXV JUST THERE! No. 42! shouted Ford Prefect to the taxi-driver. RIGHT HERE! The taxi lurched to a halt, and Ford and Arthur jumped out. They had stopped at quite a number of cash-dispensers on the way, and Ford chucked a fistful of money through the window at the driver. The entrance to the club was dark, smart, and severe. Only the smallest little plaque bore its name. Members knew where it was, and if you weren't a member, then knowing where it was wasn't any help to you. Ford Prefect was not a member of Stavros, though he had once been to Stavros' other club in New York. He had a very simple method of dealing with establishments of which he was not a member. He simply swept in as soon as the door was opened, pointed back at Arthur, and said, It's OK, he's with me. He bounded down the dark, glossy stairs, feeling very fruity in his new shoes. They were suede and they were blue, and he was very pleased that in spite of everything else going on he had been sharp-eyed enough to spot them in a shop window from the back of a speeding taxi. I thought I told you not to come here. What? said Ford. A thin, ill-looking man, wearing something baggy and Italian, was walking up the stairs past them, lighting a cigarette, and had stopped suddenly. Not you, he said him. He looked straight at Arthur, then seemed to become a little confused. Excuse me, he said. I think I must have mistaken you for someone else. He started on up the stairs again, but almost immediately turned round once more, even more puzzled. He stared at Arthur. Now what? said Ford. What did you say? I said, Now what? repeated Ford irritably. Yes, I think so, said the man, and swayed slightly, and dropped the book of matches he had been carrying. His mouth moved weakly, then he put his hand to his forehead. Excuse me, he said. I am trying desperately to remember which drug I have just taken. It must be one of those which means he can't remember. He shook his head and turned away again, and went up towards the men's-room. Come on! said Ford. He hurried on downstairs, with Arthur following nervously in his wake. The encounter had shaken him badly, and he didn't know why. He didn't like places like this. For all of the dreams of earth and home he had had for years. He now badly missed his hut on Lamuella, with his knives and his sandwiches. He even missed old Threshbark. Arthur! It was the most astounding effect. His name was being shouted in the stereo. He twisted to look one way, up the stairs behind him. He saw Trillian hurrying down towards him in her wonderfully rumpled rimplon. She was looking suddenly aghast. He twisted the other way to see what she was looking suddenly aghast at. At the bottom of the stairs was Trillian wearing—no, this was Trisha—Trisha that he had just seen, hysterical with confusion, on television, and behind her was Random, looking more wild-eyed than ever. Behind her, in the recesses of the smart, dimly lit club, the other clientele of the evening formed a frozen tableau, staring anxiously up at the confrontation on the stairs. For a few seconds everyone stood stock-still, only the music from behind the bar didn't know to stop rubbing. "'The gun she is holding,' said Ford, quietly, nodding slightly towards Random. "'Is a Wabanata Three. It was in the ship she stole from me. It's quite dangerous, in fact. Just don't move for a moment. Let's everybody just stay calm and find out what's upsetting her.' "'Where do I fit?' screamed Random suddenly. The hand holding the gun was trembling fiercely. Her other hand delved into her pocket and pulled out the remains of Arthur's watch. She shook it at them. "'I thought I would fit here,' she cried. "'On the world it made me! But it turns out that even my mother doesn't know who I am!' She flung the watch violently aside, and it smashed into the glasses behind the bar, scattering its innards. Everyone was very quiet for a moment or two longer. "'Random!' said Trillian quietly, from up on the stairs. "'Shut up!' shouted Random. "'You abandoned me!' "'Random, it is very important that you listen to me and understand,' persisted Trillian quietly. "'There isn't very much time. We must leave. We must all leave.' "'What are you talking about? We're always leaving!' She had both hands on the gun now, and both were shaking. There was no one in particular she was pointing it at. She was just pointing it at the world in general. "'Listen,' said Trillian again. "'I left you because I went to cover a war for the Network. It was extremely dangerous. At least I thought it was going to be. I arrived, and the war had suddenly ceased to happen. There was a time anomaly, and—' "'Listen! Please listen!' "'A reconnaissance battleship had failed to turn up. The rest of the fleet was scattered in some farcical disarray. It's happening all the time now.' "'I don't care! I don't want to hear about your bloody job!' shouted Random. "'I want a home! I want to fit somewhere!' "'This is not your home,' said Trillian, still keeping her voice calm. "'You don't have one. We none of us have one. Hardly anybody has one any more. The missing ship I was just talking about—the people of that ship—don't have a home. They don't know where they're from. They don't even have any memory of who they are or what they're for. They are very lost and very confused and very frightened. They are here in the Solar System, and they are about to do something very misguided because they are so lost and confused. We must leave now. I can't tell you where there is to go to. Perhaps there isn't anywhere. But here is not the place to be. Please, one more time, can we go?' Random was wavering in panic and confusion. "'It's all right,' said Arthur, gently. "'If I'm here, we're safe. Don't ask me to explain just now, but I am safe, so you are safe. Okay?' "'What are you saying, Sir Trillian?' "'Let's all just relax,' said Arthur. He was feeling very tranquil. His life was charmed, and none of this seemed real. Slowly, gradually, Random began to relax and to let the gun down, inch by inch. Two things happened simultaneously. The door to the men's room at the top of the stairs opened, and the man who had accosted Arthur came out, sniffing. Startled at the sudden movement, Random lifted the gun again, just as a man standing behind her made a grab for it. Arthur threw himself forward. There was a deafening explosion. He fell awkwardly as Trillian threw herself down over him. The noise died away. Arthur looked up to see the man at the top of the stairs, gazing down at him with a look of utter stupefaction. "'You!' he said, and slowly, horribly, he fell apart. Random threw the gun down and fell to her knees, sobbing. "'I'm sorry,' she said. "'I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry!' Nature went to her. Trillian went to her. Arthur sat on the stairs with his head between his hands, and had not the faintest idea what to do. Ford was sitting on the stair beneath him. He picked something up, looked at it with interest, and passed it up to Arthur. "'This mean anything to you?' he said. Arthur took it. It was the book of matches which the dead man had dropped. It had the name of the club on it. It had the name of the proprietor of the club on it. It read like this, Stavro Muller, Beater. He stared at it for some time, as things began slowly to reassemble themselves in his mind. He wondered what he should do, but he only wondered it idly. Around him people were beginning to rush and shout a lot. But it was suddenly very clear to him that there was nothing to be done, not now or ever. Through the new strangeness of noise and light he could just make out the shape of Ford Prefect sitting back and laughing wildly. A tremendous feeling of peace came over him. He knew that at last, for once and for ever, it was now all finally over. In the darkness of the bridge at the heart of the Vogon ship, prosthetic Vogon jelts sat alone. Lights flared briefly across the external vision-screens that lined one wall. In the air above him the discontinuities and the blue and green watery sausage-shape resolved themselves. Options collapsed, possibilities folded into each other, and the whole at last resolved itself out of existence. A very deep darkness descended. The Vogon captain sat immersed in it for a few seconds. Light, he said. There was no response. The bird, too, had crumpled out of all possibility. The Vogon turned on the light himself. He picked up the piece of paper again and placed a little tick in the little box. Well, that was done. His ship slunk off into the inky void. In spite of having taken what he regarded as an extremely positive piece of action, the Grebulon leader ended up having a very bad month after all. It was pretty much the same as all the previous months, except that there was now nothing on the television any more. He put on a little light music instead.
 Chapter XIX It was a sight that Arthur never quite got used to or tired of. He and Ford had tracked their way swiftly along the side of the small river that flowed down along the bed of the valley, and when at last they reached the margin of the plains they pulled themselves up into the branches of a large tree, to get a better view of one of the stranger and more wonderful visions that the galaxy has to offer. The great thunderous herd of thousand upon thousand of perfectly normal beasts was sweeping in magnificent array across the Anjondo plain. In the early pale light of the morning, as the great animals charged through the fine steam of the sweat of their bodies mingled with the muddy mist churned up by their pounding hooves, their appearance seemed a little unreal and ghostly anyway, but what was heart-stopping about them was where they came from and where they went to, which appeared to be simply nowhere. They formed a solid charging phalanx roughly a hundred yards wide and half a mile long. The phalanx never moved, except that it exhibited a slight gradual drift sideways and backwards for the eight or nine days that it regularly appeared for. But though the phalanx stayed more or less constant, the great beasts of which it was composed charged steadily at upwards of twenty miles an hour, appearing suddenly from thin air at one end of the plain and disappearing equally abruptly at the other end. No one knew where they came from. No one knew where they went. They were so important to the lives of the Lamuelans it was almost as if nobody liked to ask. Old Thrashbarg had said on one occasion that sometimes if you received an answer the question might be taken away. Some of the villagers had privately said that this was the only properly wise thing that they had ever heard Thrashbarg say, and after a short debate on the matter had put it down to chance. The noise of the pounding of the hooves was so intense that it was hard to hear anything else above it. "'What did you say?' shouted Arthur. "'I said,' shouted Ford, "'this looks like it might be some kind of evidence of dimensional drift.' "'Which is what?' shouted Arthur back. "'Well, a lot of people are beginning to worry that space-time is showing signs of cracking up with everything that's happening to it. There are quite a lot of worlds where you can see how the land masses have cracked up and moved around just from the weirdly long and meandering routes that migrating animals take. This might be something like we live in twisted times, still in the absence of a decent space-port.' Arthur looked at him in a kind of frozen way. "'What do you mean?' he said. "'What do you mean, what do I mean?' shouted Ford. "'You know perfectly well what I mean. We're going to ride our way out of here.' "'Are you seriously suggesting we try to ride a perfectly normal beast?' "'Yes. See where it goes to.' "'We'll be killed.' "'No,' said Arthur suddenly. "'We won't be killed. At least I won't. Ford, have you ever heard of a planet called Stavromula Beta?' Ford frowned. "'Don't think so,' he said. He pulled out his own battered old copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and accessed it. "'Any funny spelling?' he said. "'Don't know,' said Arthur. "'I've only ever heard it said, and that was by someone who had a mouthful of other people's teeth. You remember I told you about Agrajag?' Ford thought for a moment. "'You mean the guy who was convinced you were getting him killed over and over again?' "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'One of the places he claimed I'd got him killed was Stavromula Beta. Someone tries to shoot me, it seems. I duck, and Agrajag, or at least one of his many reincarnations, gets hit. It seems that this has definitely happened at some point in time, so I suppose I can't get killed at least until after I've ducked on Stavromula Beta. Only no one's ever heard of it.' "'Hmm!' Ford tried a few other searches of The Hitchhiker's Guide, but drew a blank. "'Nothing,' he said. "'Oh, well,' said Arthur. "'I was just—' "'No, no, I've never heard of it,' said Ford finally. He wondered why it was ringing a very, very faint bell, though. "'Okay,' said Arthur. "'I've seen the way the Lamuelan hunters trap perfectly normal beasts. If you spear one in the herd it just gets trampled, so they have to lure them out one at a time for the kill. It's very like the way a matador works, you know, with a brightly coloured cape. You get one to charge at you, and then step aside and execute a rather elegant swing through with the cape. Have you got anything like a brightly coloured cape about you?' "'This do,' said Ford, handing him his towel. "'I've never seen anything like it, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.' "'I've never seen anything like it either, sir.'
 The clouds sank more heavily over the land, clenching into huge sullen towers, as Dirk, in a sudden access of alarm, had to call out the man from the garage once again. He was slower to arrive with his truck this time, and bad-tempered with drink when at last he did. He emitted a few intemperate barks of laughter at Dirk's predicament, then fumbled the bonnet of his car open, and subjected him to all kinds of muttered talk about manifolds, pumps, alternators, and starlings, and resolutely would not be drawn on whether or not he was going to be able to get the thing to go again that night. Dirk was unable to get a meaningful answer, or at least an answer that meant anything to him, as to what was causing the rumpus in the alternator, what ailed the fuel pump, in what way the operation of the starter motor was being disrupted, and why the timing was off. He did at last understand that the mechanic was also claiming that a family of starlings had at some time in the past made their nest in a sensitive part of the engine's workings, and had subsequently perished horribly, taking sensitive parts of the engine with them, and at this point Dirk began to cast about himself desperately for what to do. He noticed that the mechanic's pick-up truck was standing nearby with its engine still running, and elected to make off with this instead. Being a slightly less slow and cumbersome runner than the mechanic, he was able to put this plan into operation with a minimum of difficulty. He swung out into the lane, drove off into the night, and parked three miles down the road. He left the van's lights on, let down its tires, and hid himself behind a tree. After about ten minutes his Jaguar came hurtling round the corner, passed the van, hauled itself to an abrupt halt, and reversed wildly back towards it. The mechanic threw open the door, leapt out, and hurried over to reclaim his property, leaving Dirk with the opportunity he needed to leap from behind the tree and reclaim his own. He spun his wheels pointedly, and drove off in a kind of grim triumph, still haunted nevertheless by anxieties to which he was unable to give a name or shape. Kate, in the meantime, had joined the dimly glowing yellow stream that led on eventually through the western suburbs of Acton and Ealing and into the heart of London. She crawled up over the westway flyover, and soon afterwards turned north up towards Primrose Hill and home. She always enjoyed driving up alongside the park, and the dark night shapes of the trees soothed her and made her long for the quietness of her bed. She found the nearest parking space she could to her front door, which was about thirty yards distant. She climbed out of the car and carefully omitted to lock it. She never left anything of value in it, and she found that it was to her advantage if people didn't have to break anything in order to find that out. The car had been stolen twice, but on each occasion it had been found abandoned twenty yards away. She didn't go straight home, but set off instead in the opposite direction to get some milk and bin liners from the small corner shop in the next street. She agreed with the gentle-faced Pakistani who ran it that she did indeed look tired, and should have an early night. But on the way back she made another small diversion to go and lean against the railings of the park, gaze into its darkness for a few minutes, and breathe in some of its cold, heavy night air. At last she started to head back towards her flat. She turned into her own road, and as she passed the first street lamp it flickered and went out, leaving her in a small pool of darkness. That sort of thing always gives one a nasty turn. It is said that there is nothing surprising about the notion of, for instance, a person suddenly thinking about someone they haven't thought about for years, and then discovering the next day that that person has in fact just died. There are always lots of people suddenly remembering people they haven't thought about for ages, and always lots of people dying. In a population the size of, say, America, the law of averages means that this particular coincidence must happen at least ten times a day, but it is none the less spooky to anyone who experiences it. By the same token there are light bulbs burning out in street lamps all the time, and a fair few of them must go pop just as someone is passing beneath them. Even so it still gives the person concerned a nasty turn, especially when the very next street lamp they pass under does exactly the same thing. Kate stood, rooted to the spot. If one coincidence can occur, she told herself, then another coincidence can occur, and if one coincidence happens to occur just after another coincidence, then that is just a coincidence. There was absolutely nothing to feel alarmed about in having a couple of street lamps go pop. She was in a perfectly normal, friendly street, with houses all around her, with their lights on. She looked up at the house next to her. Unfortunately, just as the lights in its front window chanced to go out. This was, presumably, because the occupants happened to choose that moment to leave the room, but though it just went to show what a truly extraordinary thing coincidence can be, it did little to improve her state of mind. The rest of the street was still bathed in a dim yellow glow. It was only the few feet immediately around her that were suddenly dark. The next pool of light was just a few footsteps away in front of her. She took a deep breath, pulled herself together and walked towards it, reaching its very centre at the exact instant that it, too, extinguished itself. The occupants of the two houses she had passed on the way also happened to choose that moment to leave their front rooms, as did their neighbours on the opposite side of the street. Perhaps a popular television show had just finished. That's what it was. Everyone was getting up and turning off their TV sets and lights simultaneously, and the resulting power surge was blowing some of the street lamps, something like that. The resulting power surge was also making her blood pound a little. She moved on, trying to be calm. As soon as she got home she'd have a look at the paper to see what the programme had been that had caused three street lamps to blow. Four. She stopped and stood absolutely still under the dark lamp. More houses were darkening. What she found particularly alarming was that they darkened at the very moment she looked at them. Glance. Pop. She tried it again. Glance. Pop. Each one she looked at darkened instantly. Glance. Pop. She realised with a sudden start of fear that she must stop herself looking at the ones that were still lit. The rationalisations she had been trying to construct were now running around inside her head screaming to be let out, and she let them go. She tried to lock her eyes to the ground for fear of extinguishing the whole street, but she couldn't help tiny glances to see if it was working. Glance. Pop. She froze her gaze down onto the narrow path forward. Most of the road was dark now. There were three remaining street lamps between her and the front door which led to her own flat. Though she kept her eyes averted, she thought she could detect on the periphery of her vision that the lights of the flat downstairs from hers were lit. Neil lived there. She couldn't remember his last name, but he was a part-time bass player and antiques dealer who used to give her decorating advice she didn't want and also stole her milk, so her relationship with him had always remained at a slightly frosty level. Just at the moment, though, she was praying that he was there to tell her what was wrong with her sofa and that his light would not go out as her eyes wavered from the pavement in front of her, with its three remaining pools of light spaced evenly along the way she had to tread. For a moment she tried turning and looked back the way she had come. All was darkness, shading off into the blackness of the park, which no longer calmed but menaced her with hideously imagined thick knotted roots and treacherous dark rotting glitter. Again she turned, sweeping her eyes low. Three pools of light. The street lights did not extinguish as she looked at them, only as she passed. She squeezed her eyes closed and visualized exactly where the lamp of the next street light was, above and in front of her. She raised her head and carefully opened her eyes again, staring directly into the orange glow radiating through the thick glass. It shone steadily. With her eyes locked fast on it, so that it burnt squiggles on her retina, she moved cautiously forward, step by step, exerting her will on it to stay burning as she approached. It continued to glow. She stepped forward again. It continued to glow. Again she stepped. Still it glowed. Now she was almost beneath it, craning her neck to keep it in focus. She moved forward once more, and saw the filament within the glass flicker and quickly die away, leaving an afterimage prancing madly in her eyes. She dropped her eyes now and tried looking steadily forward, but wild shapes were leaping everywhere, and she felt she was losing control. The next lamp she took a lunging run towards, and again sudden darkness enveloped her arrival. She stopped there panting and blinking, trying to calm herself again and get her vision sorted out. Looking towards the last street lamp, she thought she saw a figure standing beneath it. It was a large form, silhouetted with jumping orange shadows. Huge horns stood upon the figure's head. She stared with mad intensity into the billowing darkness, and suddenly screamed at it. Who are you? There was a pause, and then a deep answering voice said, Do you have anything that can get these bits of floorboard off my back?
 Chapter 2. One of the extraordinary things about life is the sort of places it is prepared to put up with living. Anywhere it can get some kind of a grip, whether it is the intoxicating seas of Santraginus V, where the fish never seem to care whatever the heck kind of direction they swim in, the fire-storms of Frastra, where they say life begins at forty thousand degrees, or just burrowing around in the lower intestine of a rat for the sheer unadulterated hell of it, life will always find a way of hanging on in somewhere. It will even live in New York, though it's hard to know why. In the wintertime the temperature falls well below the legal minimum, or rather it would do if anybody had the common sense to set a legal minimum. The last time anybody made a list of the top hundred character attributes of New Yorkers, common sense snuck in at number seventy-nine. In the summer it's too darn hot. It's one thing to be the sort of life-form that thrives on heat and finds as the frustrans do that the temperature range between forty thousand and forty thousand and four is very equable, but it's quite another to be the sort of animal that has to wrap itself up in lots of other animals at one point in your planet's orbit, and then to find half an orbit later that your skin is bubbling. Spring is overrated. A lot of the inhabitants of New York will honk on mightily about the pleasures of spring, but if they actually knew the first thing about the pleasures of spring, they would know of at least five thousand nine hundred and eighty-three better places to spend it than New York, and that's just on the same latitude. Fall, though, is the worst. Few things are worse than fall in New York. Some of the things that live in the lower intestines of rats would disagree, but most of the things that live in the lower intestines of rats are highly disagreeable anyway, so their opinion can and should be discounted. When it's fall in New York, the air smells as if someone's been frying goats in it, and if you're keen to breathe, the best plan is to open a window and stick your head in a building. Tricia Macmillan loved New York. She kept on telling herself this over and over again. The Upper West Side, yeah, Midtown, hey, great retail, Soho, the East Village, clothes, books, sushi, Italian, delis, yo. Movies, yo also. Tricia had just been to see Woody Allen's new movie, which was all about the angst of being neurotic in New York. He had made one or two other movies that had explored the same theme, and Tricia wondered if he had ever considered moving, but heard that he had set his face against the idea. So, more movies, she guessed. Tricia loved New York because loving New York was a good career move. It was a good retail move, a good cuisine move, not a good taxi move or a great quality of payment move, but definitely a career move that ranked amongst the highest and the best. Tricia was a TV anchor person, and New York was where most of the world's TV was anchored. Tricia's TV anchoring had been done exclusively in Britain up to that point. Regional news and breakfast news, early evening news. She would have been called, if the language allowed, a rapidly rising anchor, but hey, this is television, what does it matter? She was a rapidly rising anchor. She had what it took, great hair, a profound understanding of strategic lip gloss, the intelligence to understand the world, and a tiny secret interior deadness that meant she didn't care. Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in life then becomes eerily easy. Tricia had only ever missed one opportunity. These days it didn't even make her tremble quite as much as it used to, to think about it. She guessed it was that bit of her that had gone dead. NBS needed a new anchor. Mo Minetti was leaving the USAM breakfast show to have a baby. She had been offered a mind-bubbling amount of money to have it on the show, but she had declined, unexpectedly, on grounds of personal privacy and taste. Teams of NBS lawyers had sieved through her contract to see if these constituted legitimate grounds, but in the end, reluctantly, they had to let her go. This was for them particularly galling because normally, reluctantly letting someone go was an expression which had its boot on quite another foot. The word was out that maybe, just maybe, a British accent would fit. The hair, the skin tone and the bridge work would have to be up to American network standards, but there had been a lot of British accents up there thanking their mothers for their Oscars, a lot of British accents singing on Broadway, some unusually big audiences tuning into British accents in wigs on Masterpiece Theatre. British accents were telling jokes on David Letterman and Jay Leno. Nobody understood the jokes, but they were really responding to the accents, so maybe it was time, just maybe, a British accent on USAM. Well, hell. That was why Tricia was here. This was why Loving New York was a great career move. It wasn't, of course, the stated reason. Her TV company back in the UK would hardly have stumped up the airfare and hotel bill for her to go job-hunting in Manhattan. Since she was chasing something like ten times her present salary, they might have felt that she could have forked out her own expenses, but she'd found a story, found a pretext, kept very quiet about anything ulterior, and they'd stumped up for the trip. A business-class ticket, of course, but her face was known and she'd smiled herself an upgrade. The right moves had got her a nice room at the Brentwood, and here she was, wondering what to do next. The word on the street was one thing, making contact was another. She had a couple of names, a couple of numbers, but all it took was being put on indeterminate hold a couple of times, and she was back at square one. She'd put out feelers, left messages, but so far none had been returned. The actual job she'd come to do she had done in the morning. The imagined job she was after was only shimmering tantalisingly on the unreachable horizon. Shit. She caught a cab from the movie theatre back to the Brentwood. The cab couldn't get close to the kerb because a big stretch limo was hogging all of the available space, and she had to squeeze her way past it. She walked out of the fetid, goat-frying air and into the blessed cool of the lobby. The fine cotton of her blouse was sticking like grime to her skin. Her hair felt as if she'd bought it at a fairground on a stick. At the front desk she asked if there were any messages, grimly expecting none. There was one. Oh, good. It had worked. She'd gone out to the movies specifically in order to make the phone-ring. She couldn't bear sitting in a hotel room waiting. She wondered. Should she open the message down here? Her clothes were itching and she longed to take them all off and just lie on the bed. She'd turned the air-conditioning way down to its bottom temperature setting, way up to its top fan setting. What she wanted more than anything else in the world at the moment was goose pimples. Then a hot shower, then a cool one, then lying on a towel on the bed again drying in the air-conditioning, then reading the message. Maybe more goose pimples, maybe all sorts of things. No. What she wanted more than anything else in the world was a job in American television at ten times her current salary. More than anything else in the world. In the world. What she wanted more than anything else at all was no longer a live issue. She sat on a chair in the lobby under a kentia palm and opened the little cellophane-windowed envelope. "'Please call,' it said. Not happy. And gave a number. The name was Gail Andrews. Gail Andrews. It wasn't the name she was expecting. It caught her unawares. She recognised it, but couldn't immediately say why. Was she Andy Martin's secretary? Hillary Bass's assistant? Martin and Bass were the two major contact calls she had made, or tried to make, at NBS. And what did not happy mean? Not happy? She was completely bewildered. Was this Woody Allen trying to contact her under an assumed name? It was a two-on-two area code number, so it was someone in New York. Who was not happy? Well, that narrowed it down a bit, didn't it? She went back to the receptionist at the desk. "'I have a problem with this message you just gave me,' she said. Someone I don't know has tried to call me and says she's not happy.' The receptionist peered at the note with a frown. "'Do you know this person?' he said. "'No,' Trisha said. "'Hmmm,' said the receptionist. "'Sounds like she's not happy about something.' "'Yes,' said Trisha. "'Looks like there's a name here,' said the receptionist. "'Gail Andrews. Do you know anybody of that name?' "'No,' said Trisha. "'Any idea what she's unhappy about?' "'No,' said Trisha. "'Have you called the number? There's a number here.' "'No,' said Trisha. "'You only just gave me the note. I'm just trying to get some more information before I ring back. Perhaps I could talk to the person who took the call.' "'Hmmm,' said the receptionist, scrutinising the note carefully. "'I don't think we have anybody called Gail Andrews here.' "'No, I realise that,' Trisha said. "'I just—' "'I'm Gail Andrews.' A voice came from behind Trisha. She turned round. "'I'm sorry?' "'I'm Gail Andrews. You interviewed me this morning.' "'Oh! Oh, good heavens, yes!' said Trisha, slightly flustered. "'I left the message for you a few hours ago. I hadn't heard, so I came by. I didn't want to miss you.' "'Oh! No, of course,' said Trisha, trying hard to get up to speed. "'I don't know about this,' said the receptionist, for whom speed was not an issue. "'Would you like me to try this number for you now?' "'No, that'll be fine, thanks, said Trisha. I can handle it now.' "'I can call this room number here for you, if that'll help,' said the receptionist, appearing at the night again. "'No, that won't be necessary, thanks,' said Trisha. "'That's my own room number. I'm the one the message was for. I think we've sorted this out now.' "'You have a nice day now,' said the receptionist." Trisha didn't particularly want to have a nice day. She was busy. She also didn't want to talk to Gail Andrews. She had a very strict cut-off point as far as fraternising with the Christians was concerned. Her colleagues called her interview subjects Christians, and would often cross themselves when they saw one walking innocently into the studio to face Trisha, particularly if Trisha was smiling warmly and showing her teeth. She turned and smiled frostily, wondering what to do. Gail Andrews was a well-groomed woman in her mid-forties. Her clothes fell within the boundaries defined by expensive good taste, but were definitely huddled up at the floatier end of those boundaries. She was an astrologer, a famous, and if rumour were true, influential astrologer, having allegedly influenced a number of decisions made by the late President Hudson, including everything from which flavour of cream-whipped to have on which day of the week to whether or not to bomb Damascus. Trisha had savaged her more than somewhat, not on the grounds of whether or not the stories about the President were true—that was old hat now. At the time, Ms Andrews had emphatically denied advising President Hudson on anything other than personal, spiritual, or dietary matters, which did not apparently include the bombing of Damascus. "'Nothing personal, Damascus,' the tabloids had hooted at the time. Now this is a neat topical little angle that Trisha had come up with about the whole issue of astrology itself. Ms Andrews had not been entirely ready for it. Trisha, on the other hand, was not entirely ready for a rematch in the hotel lobby. What to do? "'I can wait for you in the bar if you need for a few minutes,' said Gail Andrews. "'But I would like to talk to you, and I am leaving the city tonight.' She seemed to be slightly anxious about something, rather than aggrieved or irate. "'Okay,' said Trisha. '...give me ten minutes.' She went up to her room. Apart from anything else, she had so little faith in the ability of the guy on the message-desk at reception to deal with anything so complicated as a message that she wanted to be doubly certain that there wasn't a note under the door. It wouldn't be the first time that messages at the desk and messages under the door had been completely at odds with each other. There wasn't one. The message light on the phone was flashing, though. She hit the message button and got the hotel operator. "'You have a message from Gary Andress,' said the operator. "'Yes,' said Trisha. An unfamiliar name. What does it say?' "'Not hippie,' said the operator. "'Not what?' said Trisha. "'Hippie. What it says. Guy says it's not a hippie. I guess he wanted you to know that. You want the number?' As she started to dictate the number, Trisha suddenly realised that this was a garbled version of the message she had already had. "'Okay, okay,' she said. "'Are there any other messages for me?' "'Room number?' Trisha couldn't work out why the operator should suddenly ask her for her number this late in the conversation, but gave it to her anyway. "'Name?' "'Macmillan. Trisha Macmillan.' Trisha spelt it patiently. "'Not Mr. McManus?' "'No. No more messages for you. Click.' Trisha sighed and dialled again. This time she gave her name and room number all over again up front. The operator showed not the slightest glimmer of recognition that they had been speaking less than ten seconds ago. "'I'm going to be in the bar,' Trisha explained. "'In the bar. If a phone call comes through for me, please would you put it through to me in the bar. "'Name?' They went through it all a couple more times, but Trisha was certain that everything that possibly could be clear was as clear as it possibly could be. She showered, put on fresh clothes, and retouched her make-up with the speed of a professional, and, looking at her bed with a sigh, left the room again. She had half a mind just to sneak off and hide. No, not really. She had a look at herself in the mirror in the elevator lobby while she was waiting. She looked cool and in charge, and if she could fool herself she could fool anybody. She was just going to have to tough it out with Gail Andrews. OK, she had given her a hard time. Sorry, but that's the game we're all in, that sort of thing. Ms Andrews had agreed to do the interview because she had a new book out, and TV exposure was free publicity. But there's no such thing as a free launch. No, she edited that line out again. What had happened was this. Last week, astronomers had announced that they had at last discovered a tenth planet, out beyond the orbit of Pluto. They had been searching for it for years, guided by certain orbital anomalies in the outer planets, and now they'd found it, and they were all terribly pleased, and everyone was terribly happy for them, and so on. The planet was named Persephone, but rapidly nicknamed Rupert, after some astronomer's parrot. There was some tediously heart-warming story attached to this, and that was all very wonderful and lovely. Tricia had followed the story with, for various reasons, considerable interest. Then, while she'd been casting around for a good excuse to go to New York at her TV company's expense, she'd happened to notice a press release about Gail Andrews and her new book, You and Your Planets. Gail Andrews was not exactly a household name, but the moment you mentioned President Hudson, cream whips, and the amputation of Damascus, the world had moved on from surgical strikes. The official term had in fact been damasectomy, meaning the taking out of Damascus. Everyone remembered who you meant. Tricia saw an angle here, which she quickly sold to her producer. Surely the notion that great lumps of rock whirling in space knew something about your day that you didn't must take a bit of a knock from the fact that there was suddenly a new lump of rock out there that nobody had known about before. That must throw a few calculations out, mustn't it? What about all those star charts and planetary motions and so on? We all knew, apparently, what happened when Neptune was in Virgo and so on, but what about when Rupert was rising? Wouldn't the whole of astrology have to be rethought? Wouldn't now perhaps be a good time to own up that it was all a load of hogwash and instead take up pig farming, the principles of which were founded on some kind of rational basis? If we'd known about Rupert three years ago, might President Hudson have been eating the boysenberry flavour on Thursday rather than Friday? Might Damascus still be standing? That sort of thing. Gail Andrews had taken it all reasonably well. She was just starting to recover from the initial onslaught when she'd made the rather serious mistake of trying to shake Tricia off by talking smoothly about diurnal arcs, right ascensions and some of the more abstruse areas of three-dimensional trigonometry. To her shock, she discovered that everything she'd delivered to Tricia came right back at her with more spin on it than she was able to cope with. Nobody had warned Gail that being a TV bimbo was, for Tricia, her second stab at a role in life. Behind her Chanel lip-gloss, her coupe sauvage and her crystal blue contact lenses lay a brain that had acquired for itself in an earlier abandoned phase of her life a first-class degree in mathematics and a doctorate in astrophysics. As she was getting into the elevator, Tricia, slightly preoccupied, realised she had left her bag in her room and wondered whether to duck back out and get it. No, it was probably safer where it was, and there wasn't anything she particularly needed in it. She let the door close behind her. Besides, she told herself, taking a deep breath, if life had taught her anything, it was this. Never go back for your bag. As the elevator went down, she stared up at the ceiling in a rather intent way. Anyone who didn't know Tricia McMillan better would have said that that was exactly the way people sometimes stared upwards when they were trying to hold back tears. She must have been staring at the tiny security video camera mounted up in the corner. She marched rather briskly out of the elevator a minute later and went up to the reception desk again. Now, I'm going to write this out, she said, because I don't want anything to go wrong. She wrote her name in large letters on a piece of paper, then her room number, then in the bar, and gave it to the receptionist who looked at it. That's in case there are any messages for me, OK? The receptionist continued to look at it. You want me to see if she's in her room? he said. Two minutes later, Tricia swivelled into the bar seat next to Gail Andrews, who was sitting in front of a glass of white wine. You struck me as the sort of person who preferred to sit up at the bar rather than demurely at a table, she said. This was true, and caught Tricia a little by surprise. Vodka? said Gail. Yes, said Tricia suspiciously. She'd just stopped herself asking, how did you know? But Gail answered anyway. She asked the barman, she said, with a kindly smile. The barman had her vodka ready for her, and slid it charmingly across the glossy mahogany. Thank you, said Tricia, staring at it sharply. She didn't know quite what to make of all this sudden niceness, and was determined not to be wrong-footed by it. People in New York were not nice to each other without reason. Miss Andrews, she said firmly, I'm sorry that you're not happy. I know you probably feel I was a bit rough with you this morning, but what I'm trying to do is, after all, just popular entertainment, which is fine. It's part of showbiz, and it's a part that you've done well out of, and good luck to you. It's fun. It's not a science, though, and it shouldn't be mistaken for one. I think that's something we both managed to demonstrate very successfully together this morning, while at the same time generating some popular entertainment, which is what we both do for a living. I'm sorry if you have a problem with that. I'm perfectly happy, said Gail Andrews. Oh, said Tricia, not quite certain what to make of this. It said in your message that you were not happy, and no, said Gail Andrews, I said in my message that I thought you were not happy, and I was just wondering why. Tricia felt as if she had been kicked in the back of the head. She blinked. What? she said quietly. To do with the stars. You seemed very angry and unhappy about something to do with stars and planets when we were having our discussion, and it's been bothering me, which is why I came to see if you were all right. Tricia stared at her. Ms. Andrews, she started, and then realised that the way she had said it sounded exactly angry and unhappy, and rather undermined the protest she had been trying to make. Please call me Gail, if that's OK. Tricia just looked bewildered. I know that astrology isn't a science, said Gail. Of course it isn't. It's just an arbitrary set of rules, like chess or tennis, or what's that strange thing you British play? Cricket? Self-loathing? Parliamentary democracy. The rules just kind of got there. They don't make any kind of sense except in terms of themselves. But when you start to exercise those rules, all sorts of processes start to happen, and you start to find out all sorts of stuff about people. In astrology, the rules happen to be about stars and planets, but they could be about ducks and drakes, for all the difference it would make. It's just a way of thinking about a problem, which lets the shape of the problem begin to emerge. The more rules, the tinier the rules, the more arbitrary they are, the better. It's like throwing a handful of fine graphite dust on a piece of paper, to see where the hidden indentations are. It lets you see the words that were written on the piece of paper above it, that's now been taken away and hidden. The graphite's not important. It's just a means of revealing their indentations. So you see, astrology has nothing to do with astronomy. It's just to do with people thinking about people. So when you got so, I don't know, so emotionally focused on stars and planets this morning, I began to think, she's not angry about astrology. She really is angry and unhappy about actual stars and planets. People usually only get that unhappy and angry when they've lost something. That's all I could think, and I couldn't make any more sense of it than that. So I came to see if you were okay. Trisha was stunned. One part of her brain had already got started on all sorts of stuff. It was busy reconstructing all sorts of rebuttals to do with how ridiculous newspaper horoscopes were, and the statistical tricks they played on people. But gradually it petered out, because it realised that the rest of her brain wasn't listening. She had been completely stunned. She had just been told, by a total stranger, something she had kept completely secret for seventeen years. She turned to look at Gail. I... She stopped. A tiny security camera up behind the bar had turned to follow her movement. This completely flummoxed her. Most people would not have noticed it. It was not designed to be noticed. It was not designed to suggest that nowadays even an expensive and elegant hotel in New York couldn't be sure that its clientele wasn't suddenly going to pull a gun or not wear a tie. But, carefully hidden though it was behind the vodka, it couldn't deceive the finely honed instinct of a TV anchorperson, which was to know exactly when a camera was turning to look at her. Is something wrong? asked Gail. No, I... I have to say that you've rather astonished me, said Tricia. She decided to ignore this security camera. It was just her imagination playing tricks with her, because she had television so much on her mind today. It wasn't the first time it had happened. A traffic-monitoring camera, she was convinced, had swung round to follow her as she walked past it. And a security camera in Bloomingdale's had seemed to make a particular point of watching her trying on hats. She was obviously going dotty. She had even imagined that a bird in Central Park had been peering at her rather intently. She decided to put it out of her mind and took a sip of her vodka. Someone was walking round the bar asking people if they were Mr. McManus. OK, she said, suddenly blurting it out. I don't know how you've worked it out, but... I didn't work it out, as you put it, said Gail. I just listened to what you were saying. What I lost, said Tricia, I think, was a whole other life. Oh, everybody does that, said Gail. Every moment of every day, every single decision we make, every breath we draw, opens some doors and closes many others. Most of them we don't notice. Some we do. Sounds like you noticed one. Oh, yes, I noticed, said Tricia. All right, here it is. It's very simple. Many years ago I met a guy at a party. He said he was from another planet and did I want to go along with him. I said, yes, OK. It was that kind of party. I said to him to wait while I went to get my bag, and then I'd be happy to go off to another planet with him. He said I wouldn't need my bag. I said he obviously came from a very backward planet, or he'd know that a woman always needed to take her bag with her. He got a bit impatient, but I wasn't going to be a complete pushover just because he said he was from another planet. I went upstairs. It took me a while to find my bag, and then there was someone else in the bathroom. Came down, and he was gone. Tricia paused. And, said Gail, the garden door was open. I went outside. There were lights, some kind of gleaming thing. I was just in time to see it rise up into the sky, shoot silently up through the clouds and disappear. That was it. End of story. End of one life, beginning of another. But hardly a moment of this life goes by that I don't wonder about some other me, a me that didn't go back for her bag. I feel like she's out there somewhere, and I'm walking in her shadow. A member of the hotel staff was now going round the bar asking people if they were Mr Miller. Nobody was. Did he really think this person was from another planet? Asked Gail. Oh, certainly. It was the spacecraft. Oh, and also he had two heads. Two? Didn't anybody else notice? It was a fancy dress party, said Tricia. Oh, I see, said Gail. And he had a birdcage over it, of course, said Tricia, with a cloth over the cage. Pretended he had a parrot. He tapped on the cage and did a lot of stupid Then he pulled the cloth back for a moment and roared with laughter. There was another head in there, laughing along with him. It was a very worrying moment, I can tell you. I think you probably did the right thing, dear, don't you? said Gail. No, said Tricia. No, I don't. And I couldn't carry on doing what I was doing, either. I was an astrophysicist, you see. You can't be an astrophysicist properly if you've actually met someone from another planet with a second head that pretends to be a parrot. You just can't do it. I couldn't, at least. I can see it would be hard, said Gail, and that's probably why you tend to be a little hard on other people who talk what sounds like complete nonsense. Yes, said Tricia. I expect you're right. I'm sorry. That's OK. You're the first person I've ever told this, by the way. I wondered, said Gail. Are you married? No. So hard to tell these days, isn't it? But you're quite right to ask, because that probably was the reason. I came very close a few times, mostly because I wanted to have a kid, but every guy ended up asking why I was constantly looking over his shoulder. What do you tell someone? At one point I even thought I might just go to a sperm bank and take potluck, have somebody's child at random. You can't seriously do that, can you? Tricia laughed. Probably not. I never quite went and found out, for real. Never quite did it. Story of my life. Never quite did the real thing. That's why I'm in television, I guess. Nothing is real. Excuse me, lady. Your name Tricia Macmillan? Tricia looked round in surprise. There was a man standing there in a chauffeur's hat. Yes, she said, instantly pulling herself back together again. Lady, I've been looking for you for about an hour. Hotel said they didn't have anybody of that name, but I checked back with Mr Martin's office and they said that this is definitely where you were staying. So I asked again. They still say they never heard of you, so I get them to page you anyway and they can't find you. In the end I get the office to fax a picture of you through to the car and have a look myself. He looked at his watch. Maybe a bit late now. Do you want to go anyway? Tricia was stunned. Mr Martin? You mean Andy Martin at NBS? That's correct, lady. Screen test for USAM. Tricia shot up out of her seat. She couldn't even bear to think of all the messages she'd heard from Mr McManus and Mr Miller. Only we have to hurry, said the chauffeur. So I heard it. Mr Martin thinks it might be worth trying a British accent. His boss at the network is dead against the idea. That's Mr Zwingler. And I happen to know he's flying out to the coast this evening, because I'm the one who has to pick him up and take him to the airport. OK, said Tricia. I'm ready. Let's go. OK, lady. It's the big limo out the front. Tricia turned back to Gail. I'm sorry, she said. Go, go, said Gail, and good luck. I've enjoyed meeting you. Tricia made to reach for her bag for some cash. She'd left it upstairs. Our drinks are on me, insisted Gail. Really, it's been very interesting. Tricia sighed. Look, I'm really sorry about this morning, and... Don't say another word. I'm fine. It's only astrology. It's harmless. It's not the end of the world. Thanks. On an impulse, Tricia gave her a hug. You got everything, said the chauffeur. You don't want to pick up your bag or anything? If there's one thing that life's taught me, said Tricia, it's never go back for your bag. Just a little over an hour later, Tricia sat on one of the pair of beds in her hotel room. For a few minutes, she didn't move. She'd a stared at her bag, which was sitting innocently on top of the other bed. In her hand was a note from Gail Andrews, saying, Don't be too disappointed. Do ring if you want to talk about it. If I were you, I'd stay in at home tomorrow night. Get some rest. But don't mind me, and don't worry. It's only astrology. It's not the end of the world. Gail. The chauffeur had been dead right. In fact, the chauffeur seemed to know more about what was going on inside NBS than any other single person she had encountered in the organisation. Martin had been keen. Swingler had not. She had had her one shot at proving Martin right, and she had blown it. Oh well. Oh well. Oh well, oh well. Time to go home. Time to find the airline and see if she could still get the red-eye back to Heathrow tonight. She reached for the big phone directory. Oh, first things first. She put down the directory again, picked up her handbag, and took it through to the bathroom. She put it down and took out the small plastic case which held her contact lenses, without which she had been unable properly to read either the script or the autocue. As she dabbed each tiny plastic cup into her eyes, she reflected that if there was one thing life had taught her, it was that there are some times when you do not go back for your bag, and other times when you do. It had yet to teach her to distinguish between the two types of occasion.
 XXII Daylight exploded around them. Hot, heavy sun. A desert plain stretched out ahead in a haze of heat. They thundered out into it. "'Jump!' shouted Ford Prefect. "'What?' shouted Arthur, holding on for dear life. There was no reply. "'What did you say?' shouted Arthur again, then realised that Ford Prefect was no longer there. He looked around in panic and started to slip. Realising he couldn't hold on any longer, he pushed himself sideways as hard as he could and rolled into a ball as he hit the ground, rolling, rolling away from the pounding hooves. "'What a day!' he thought, as he started furiously coughing dust up out of his lungs. He hadn't had a day as bad as this since the earth had been blown up. He staggered up to his knees and then up to his feet and started to run away. He didn't know what from or what to, but running away seemed a prudent move. He ran straight into Ford Prefect, who was standing there surveying the scene. "'Look!' said Ford. "'That is precisely what we need.' Arthur coughed up some more dust and wiped some other dust out of his hair and eyes. He turned, panting, to look at what Ford was looking at. It didn't look much like the domain of a king, or the king, or any kind of king. It looked quite inviting, though. First the context. This was a desert world. The dusty earth was packed hard and had neatly bruised every last bit of Arthur that hadn't been already bruised by the festivities of the previous night. Some way ahead of them were great cliffs that looked like sandstone, eroded by the wind and what little rain presumably fell in these parts into wild and fantastic shapes, which matched the fantastic shapes of the giant cacti that sprouted here and there from the arid orange landscape. For a moment Arthur dared to hope that they had unexpectedly arrived in Arizona, or New Mexico, or maybe South Dakota, but there was plenty of evidence that this was not the case. The perfectly normal beasts, for a start, still thundering, still pounding. They swept up in their tens of thousands from the far horizon, disappeared completely for about half a mile, then swept off, thundering and pounding to the distant horizon opposite. Then there were the spaceships parked in front of the Bar and Grill. Ah, the domain of the king, Bar and Grill. A bit of an anticlimax, thought Arthur to himself. In fact only one of the spaceships was parked in front of the domain of the king, Bar and Grill. The other three were in a parking lot by the side of the Bar and Grill. It was the one in front that caught the eye, though. A wonderful looking thing, wild fins all over it, far, far too much chrome all over the fins, and most of the actual body-work painted in a shocking pink. It crouched there like an immense brooding insect, and looked as if it was at any moment about to jump on something about a mile away. The domain of the king, Bar and Grill, was slap-bang in the middle of where the perfectly normal beasts would be charging if they didn't take a minor trans-dimensional diversion on the way. It stood on its own undisturbed, an ordinary Bar and Grill, a truck-stop diner, somewhere in the middle of nowhere, quiet. The domain of the king. "'Gonna buy that spaceship,' said Ford quietly. "'Buy it,' said Arthur. "'That's not like you. I thought you usually pinched them.' "'Sometimes you have to show a little respect,' said Ford. "'Probably have to show a little cash as well,' said Arthur. "'How the hell much is that thing worth?' With a tiny movement Ford brought his dino-charge credit-card up out of his pocket. Arthur noticed that the hand holding it was trembling very slightly. "'I'll teach them to make me their restaurant critic,' breathed Ford. "'What do you mean?' asked Arthur. "'I'll show you,' said Ford, with a nasty glint in his eye. "'Let's go and run up a few expenses, shall we?' "'Couple of beers,' said Ford, and—I don't know—a couple of bacon rolls, whatever you got. Oh, and that pink thing outside—' He flipped his card onto the top of the Bar and looked around casually. There was a kind of silence. There hadn't been a lot of noise before, but there was definitely a kind of silence now. Even the distant thunder of the perfectly normal beasts, carefully avoiding the domain of the King, seemed suddenly a little muted. "'Just roll into town,' said Ford, as if nothing was odd about that or about anything else. He was leaning against the Bar at an extravagantly relaxed angle. There were about three other customers in the place, sitting at tables, nursing beers—about three. Some people would have said there were exactly three, but it wasn't that kind of a place—not the kind of a place that he felt like being that specific in. There was some big guy setting up some stuff on the little stage as well—old drum-kit, couple of guitars, country and western kind of stuff. The barman was not moving very swiftly to get in Ford's order. In fact he wasn't moving at all. "'Not sure that the pink thing's for sale,' he said at last, in the kind of accent that went on for quite a long time. "'Sure it is,' said Ford. "'How much do you want?' "'Well—think of a number. I'll double it.' "'Taint my undersell,' said the barman. "'So, whose?' The barman nodded at the big guy setting up on the stage—big fat guy, moving slow, balding. Ford nodded. He grinned. "'Okay,' he said. "'Get the beers, get the rolls, keep the tab open.' Arthur sat at the bar and rested. He was used to not knowing what was going on. He felt comfortable with it. The beer was pretty good, and it made him feel a little sleepy, which he didn't mind at all. The bacon rolls were not bacon rolls, they were perfectly normal beast rolls. He exchanged a few professional roll-making remarks with the barman, and just let Ford get on with whatever Ford wanted to do. "'Okay,' said Ford, returning to his tool. "'It's cool. We got the pink thing.' The barman was very surprised. "'He's selling it to you?' "'He's giving it to us for free,' said Ford, taking a gnaw at his roll. "'Hey, no, keep the tab open, though. We have some items to add to it. Good roll.' He took a deep pull of beer. "'Good beer,' he added. "'Good ship, too,' he said, eyeing the big pink-and-chrome insect-like thing, bits of which could be seen through the windows of the bar. "'Good everything, pretty much. You know,' he said, sitting back reflectively, "'it's the times like this that you kind of wonder if it's worth worrying about the fabric of space-time and the causal integrity of the multidimensional probability matrix and the potential collapse of all waveforms and the whole sort of general mishmash and all that sort of stuff that's been bugging me. Maybe I feel that what the big guy says is right. Just let it all go. What does it matter? Let it go.' "'Which big guy?' said Arthur. Ford just nodded towards the stage. "'The big guy,' I was saying. "'One, two.' He turned to the mic a couple of times. A couple of other guys were on the stage now, drums, guitar. The barman, who had been silent for a moment or two, said, "'You say he's letting you have his ship?' "'Yeah,' said Ford. "'Let it all go,' is what he said. "'Take the ship. Take it with my blessing. Be good to her. I will be good to her.' He took a pull of his beer again. "'Like I was saying,' he said, "'it's the times like this that you kind of think, let it all go, but then you think of guys like InfiniDim Enterprises, and you think they are not going to get away with it. They are going to suffer. It is my sacred and holy duty to see those guys suffer. Here, let me put something on the tab for the singer. I asked for a special request and we agreed. It's to go on the tab, OK?' "'OK,' said the barman cautiously. Then he shrugged. "'OK. However you want to do it. How much?' Ford named a figure. The barman fell over amongst the bottles and glasses. Ford vaulted quickly over the bar to check that he was all right, and to help him back up to his feet. He had cut his finger, and his elbow, albeit, was feeling a little woozy, but was otherwise fine. The big guy started to sing. The barman hobbled off with Ford's credit card to get authorization. "'Is there stuff going on here that I don't know about?' said Arthur to Ford. "'Isn't there usually?' said Ford. "'No need to be like that,' said Arthur. He began to wake up. "'Shouldn't we be going?' he said suddenly. "'Will that ship get us to Earth?' "'It sure will,' said Ford. "'That's where Random will be going,' said Arthur with a start. "'We can follow her. But, er—' Ford let Arthur get on with thinking things out for himself while he got out his old edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. "'But where are we on this probability-axis thing?' said Arthur. "'Will the Earth be there or not there? I've spent so much time looking for it. All I've found was planets that were a bit like it or not at all like it, though it was clearly the right place because of the continents. The worst version was called Now What, where I got bitten by some wretched little animal. That's how they communicated, you know, by biting each other. Bloody painful. Then half the time, of course, the Earth isn't even there because it's been blown up by the bloody Vogons. How much sense am I making?' Ford didn't comment. He was listening to something. He passed the guide over to Arthur and pointed at the screen. The active entry read, "'Earth. Mostly harmless.' "'You mean it's there?' said Arthur excitedly. "'The Earth is there! That's where Random will be going. The bird was showing her the Earth in the rainstorm!' Ford motioned Arthur to shout a little less loudly. He was listening. Arthur was growing impatient. He had heard bar singers sing Love Me Tender before. He was a bit surprised to hear it here, right in the middle of wherever the hell this was—certainly not Earth. But then things tended not to surprise him these days as much as formerly. The singer was quite good, as bar singers went, if you like that sort of thing, but Arthur was getting fretful. He glanced at his watch. This only served to remind him that he didn't have his watch any more. Random had it, or at least the remains of it. "'Don't you think we should be going?' he said insistently. "'Shh!' said Ford. "'I paid to hear this song.' He seemed to have tears in his eyes, which Arthur found a bit disturbing. He had never seen Ford moved by anything other than a very, very strong drink. Probably the dust. He waited, tapping his fingers irritably, out of time with the music. The song ended. The singer went on to do Heartbreak Hotel. "'Anyway,' Ford whispered, "'I've got to review the restaurant.' "'What?' "'I have to write a review.' "'Write a review? Of this place?' "'Filing the review validates the expenses claim. I fixed it so that it happens completely automatically and untraceably. This bill is going to need some validation,' he added quietly, staring into his beer with a nasty smirk. "'For a couple of beers and a roll?' "'And a tip for the singer,' said Ford. "'Why? How much did you tip him?' Ford named a figure again. "'I don't know how much that is,' said Arthur. "'What's it worth in pounds sterling? I mean, what would it buy you?' "'It would probably buy you roughly—er—' Ford screwed his eyes up as he did some calculations in his head. "'Switzerland,' he said at last. He picked up his hitchhiker's guide and started to type. Arthur nodded intelligently. There were times when he wished he understood what on earth Ford was talking about, and other times, like now, when he felt it was probably safer not even to try. He looked over Ford's shoulder. "'This isn't going to take long, is it?' he said. "'Nah,' said Ford. "'Piece of piss. Just mentioned that the rolls are quite good, the beer good and cold, local wildlife nicely eccentric, the bar singer the best in the known universe, and that's about it. Doesn't need much, just a validation.' He touched an area on the screen marked Enter, and the message vanished into the sub-ether. "'You thought the singer was pretty good, then?' said Arthur. "'Yeah,' said Ford. The barman was returning with a piece of paper which seemed to be trembling in his hand. He pushed it over to Ford with a kind of nervous reverential twitch. "'Funny thing,' said the barman. "'The system rejected it a couple of times. Can't say it surprised me.' Beads of sweat were standing on his brow. "'Then suddenly it's—' "'Oh, yeah, that's okay, and the system validates it. Just like that. "'Sign it?' Ford scanned the form quickly. He sucked his teeth. "'This is going to hurt and finnard him a lot,' he said, with an appearance of concern. "'Oh, well,' he added softly. "'Screw him.' He signed with a flourish and handed it back to the barman. "'More money,' he said, "'than the Colonel made for him in an entire career of doing crap movies and casino gigs, "'just for doing what he does best—standing up and singing in a bar. "'And he negotiated it himself. "'I think this is a good moment for him. Tell him I said thanks and buy him a drink.' He tossed a few coins on the bar. The barman pushed them away. "'I don't think that's necessary,' he said slightly hoarsely. "'Tis to me,' said Ford. "'Okay, we are out of here.' They stood out in the heat and the dust and looked at the big pink and chrome thing with amazement and admiration. Or at least Ford looked at it with amazement and admiration. Arthur just looked at it. "'You don't think it's a bit overdone, do you?' He said it again when they climbed inside it. The seats and quite a lot of the controls are covered in fine fur-skin or suede. There was a big gold monogram on the main control panel, which just read EP. "'You know,' said Ford, as he fired up the ship's engines, "'I asked him if it was true that he had been abducted by aliens, and you know what he said?' "'Who?' said Arthur. "'The King.' "'Which King? We've had this conversation, haven't we?' "'Never mind,' said Ford. For what it's worth he said no. He went of his own accord. "'I'm still not sure who we're talking about,' said Arthur.' Ford shook his head. "'Look,' he said, "'there are some tapes over in the compartment to your left. Why don't you choose some music and put it on?' "'Okay,' said Arthur, and flipped through the curtains. "'Oh, do you like Elvis Presley?' he said. "'Yeah, as a matter of fact I do,' said Ford. "'Now I hope this machine can leap like it looks like it can.' He engaged the main drive. "'Yee-haw!' shouted Ford as they shot upwards at face-tearing speed. "'It could!'
 As Dirk edged his way along the Euston Road, caught in the middle of a rush-hour traffic jam that had started in the late 1970s, and which, at a quarter to ten on this Thursday evening, still showed no signs of abating, he thought he caught sight of something he recognised. It was his subconscious which told him this. That infuriating part of a person's brain which never responds to interrogation, merely gives little meaningful nudges, and then sits humming quietly to itself, saying nothing. "'Well, of course I've just seen something I recognise,' Dirk muttered mentally to his subconscious. "'I drive along this benighted thoroughfare twenty times a month. I expect I recognise every single matchstick lying in the gutter. Can't you be a little bit more specific?' His subconscious would not be hectored, though, and was dumb. It had nothing further to add. The city was probably full of grey vans, anyway. Very unremarkable. "'Where?' Dirk muttered to himself fiercely, twisting round in his seat, this way and that. "'Where did I see a grey van?' "'Nothing.' He was thoroughly hemmed in by the traffic, and could not manoeuvre in any direction, least of all forward. He erupted from his car, and started to jostle his way back through the jammed cars, bobbing up and down to try and see where, if anywhere, he might have caught a glimpse of a grey van. If he had seen one, it eluded him now. His subconscious sat and said nothing. The traffic was still not moving, so he tried to thread his way further back, but was obstructed by a large motorcycle courier edging his way forward on a huge, grimy Kawasaki. Dirk engaged in a brief altercation with the courier, but lost it, because the courier was unable to hear Dirk's side of the altercation. Eventually Dirk retreated through the tide of traffic, which now was beginning slowly to move in all lanes other than the one in which his car sat, driverless, immobile, and hooted at. He felt suddenly elated by the braying of the motor-horns, and as he swayed and bobbed his way back through the snarled-up column of cars, he suddenly found that he reminded himself of the crazies he had seen on the streets of New York, who would courier out into the road to explain to the oncoming traffic about the Day of Judgment, imminent alien invasions, and incompetence and corruption in the Pentagon. He put his hands above his head and started to shout out, The gods are walking the earth! The gods are walking the earth! This further inflamed the feelings of those who were beeping their horns at his stationary car, and quickly the whole rose through a crescendo of majestic cacophony, with Dirk's voice ringing out above it. The gods are walking the earth! The gods are walking the earth! he hollered. The gods are walking the earth! Thank you, he added, and ducked down into his car, put it into drive, and pulled away, allowing the whole jammed mass at last to seethe easily forward. He wondered why he was so sure. An act of God! Merely a chance, careless phrase by which people were able to dispose conveniently of awkward phenomena that would admit of no more rational explanation. But it was the chance carelessness of it which particularly appealed to Dirk, because words used carelessly, if they did not matter in any serious way, often allowed otherwise well-guarded truths to seep through. An inexplicable disappearance! Oslo and a hammer! A tiny, tiny coincidence which struck a tiny, tiny note. However, it was a note which sang in the midst of the daily hubbub of white noise, and other tiny notes were singing at the same pitch. An act of God! Oslo and a hammer! A man with a hammer trying to go to Norway is prevented, loses his temper, and as a result there is an act of God. If, thought Dirk, if a being were immortal, he would still be alive to-day. That, quite simply, was what immortal meant. How would an immortal being have a passport? Quite simply, how? Dirk tried to imagine what might happen if, to pick a name quite at random, the god Thor, he of the Norwegian ancestry and the great hammer, were to arrive at the passport office and try to explain who he was and how come he had no birth certificate. There would be no shock, no horror, no loud exclamations of astonishment, just blank bureaucratic impossibility. It wouldn't be a matter of whether anybody believed him or not, it would simply be a question of producing a valid birth certificate. He could stand there wreaking miracles all day if he liked, but at close of business, if he didn't have a valid birth certificate, he would simply be asked to leave. And credit cards. If, to sustain for a moment the same arbitrary hypothesis, the god Thor were alive and for some reason at large in England, then he would probably be the only person in the country who did not receive the constant barrage of invitations to apply for an American Express card, crude threats by the same post to take their American Express cards away, and gift catalogues full of sumptuously unpleasant things lavishly tooled in knaft-brown plastic. Dirk found the idea quite breathtaking. That is, if he were the only god at large, which, once you were to accept the first extravagant hypothesis, was hardly likely to be the case. But imagine for a moment such a person attempting to leave the country, armed with no passport, no credit cards, merely the power to throw thunderbolts and who knew what else. You'd probably have to imagine a scene very similar to the one that did in fact occur at Terminal 2 Heathrow. But why, if you were a Norse god, would you be needing to leave the country by means of a scheduled airline? Surely there were other means. Dirk rather thought that one of the perks of being an immortal divine might be the ability to fly under your own power. From what he remembered of his reading of the Norse legends many years ago, the gods were continually flying all over the place, and there was never any mention of them hanging around in departure-lounds eating crummy buns. Admittedly, the world was not, in those days, bristling with air-traffic controllers, radar, missile-warning systems, and the like. Still, a quick hop across the North Sea shouldn't be that much of a problem for a god, particularly if the weather was in your favour, which, if you were the god of thunder, you'd pretty much expect it to be, or want to know the reason why. Should it? Another tiny note sang in the back of Dirk's mind, and then was lost in the hubbub. He wondered for a moment what it was like to be a whale. Physically, he thought, he was probably quite well placed to get some good insights, though whales were better adapted for their lives of gliding about in the vast pelagic blueness than he was for his of struggling up through the Pentonville Road traffic in a weary old Jaguar. But what he was thinking of, in fact, was the whales' songs. In the past, whales have been able to sing to each other across whole oceans, even from one ocean to another, because sound travels such huge distances underwater. But now, again because of the way in which sound travels, there is no part of the ocean that is not constantly jangling with the hubbub of ship's motors, through which it is now virtually impossible for the whales to hear each other's songs or messages. So, fucking what, is pretty much the way that most people tended to view this problem, and understandably so, thought Dirk. After all, who wants to hear a bunch of fat fish or white mammals burping at each other? But, for a moment, Dirk had a sense of infinite loss and sadness, that somewhere amongst the frenzy of information noise that daily rattled the lives of men, he thought he might have heard a few notes that denoted the movements of gods. As he turned north into Islington, and began the long haul up past the pizza restaurants and estate agents, he felt almost frantic at the idea of what their lives must now be like.
 Chapter 6 Ford Prefect hit the ground running. The ground was about three inches further from the ventilation shaft than he remembered it, so he misjudged the point at which he would hit the ground, started running too soon, stumbled awkwardly, and twisted his ankle. Damn! He ran off down the corridor anyway, hobbling slightly. All over the building alarms were erupting into their usual frenzy of excitement. He'd die for cover behind the usual storage cabinets, glance around to check that he was unseen, and started rapidly to fish around inside his satchel for the usual things he needed. His ankle, unusually, was hurting like hell. The ground was not only three inches further from the ventilation shaft than he remembered, it was also on a different planet than he remembered, but it was the three inches that had caught him by surprise. The offices of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy were quite often shifted at very short notice to another planet, for reasons of local climate, local hostility, power bills, or tax, but they were always reconstructed exactly the same way, almost to the very molecule. For many of the company's employees, the layout of their offices represented the only constant they knew in a severely distorted personal universe. Something, though, was odd. This was not in itself surprising, thought Ford, as he pulled out his lightweight throwing-towel. Virtually everything in his life was, to a greater or lesser extent, odd. It was just that this was odd in a slightly different way than he was used to things being odd, which was, well, strange. He couldn't quite get it into focus immediately. He got out his No. 3 gauge-prizing tool. The alarms were going in the same old way that he knew well. There was a kind of music to them that he almost hummed along to. That was all very familiar. The world outside had been a new one on Ford. He had not been to Sacropillia Henshire before, and he liked it. It had a kind of carnival atmosphere to it. He took from his satchel a toy bow and arrow, which he had bought in a street market. He had discovered that the reason for the carnival atmosphere on Sacropillia Henshire was that the local people were celebrating the annual feast of the Assumption of St. Antwelm. St. Antwelm had been, during his lifetime, a great and popular king, who had made a great and popular assumption. What King Antwelm had assumed was that what everybody wanted, all other things being equal, was to be happy and enjoy themselves and have the best possible time together. On his death he had willed his entire personal fortune to financing an annual festival to remind everyone of this, with lots of good food and dancing and very silly games like Hunt the Wocket. His assumption had been such a brilliantly good one that he was made into a saint for it. Not only that, but all the people who had previously been made saints for doing things like being stoned to death in a thoroughly miserable way, or living up side down in barrels of dung, were instantly demoted and were now thought to be rather embarrassing. The familiar H-shaped building of the Hitchhiker's Guide offices rose above the outskirts of the city, and Ford Prefect, on arriving at it, had broken into it in the familiar way. He always entered via the ventilation system rather than the main lobby, because the main lobby was patrolled by robots, whose job it was to quiz incoming employees about their expense accounts. Ford Prefect's expense accounts were notoriously complex and difficult affairs, and he had found on the whole that the lobby robots were ill-equipped to understand the arguments he wished to put forward in relation to them, and he preferred, therefore, to make his entrance by another route. This meant setting off nearly every alarm in the building, but not the one in the Accounts Department, which was the way that Ford preferred it. He hunkered down behind the storage cabinet, he licked the rubber suction cup of the toy arrow, and then fitted it to the string of the bow. Within about thirty seconds a security robot the size of a small melon came flying down the corridor at about waist height, scanning left and right for anything unusual as it did so. With impeccable timing Ford shot the toy arrow across its path. The arrow flew across the corridor and stuck wobbling on the opposite wall. As it flew the robot sensors locked on to it instantly, and the robot twisted through ninety degrees to follow it, to see what the hell it was and where it was going. This bought Ford Prefect one precious second, during which the robot was looking in the opposite direction from him. He hurled the towel over the flying robot and caught it. Because of the various sensory protuberances with which the robot was festooned it couldn't manoeuvre inside the towel, and it just twitched back and forth without being able to turn and face its captor. Ford hauled it quickly towards him and pinned it down to the ground. It was beginning to whine pitifully. With one swift and practised movement Ford reached under the towel with his three-gauge prising tool and flipped off the small plastic panel on top of the robot, which gave access to its logic circuits. Now, logic is a wonderful thing, but it has, as the processes of evolution discovered, certain drawbacks. Anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something else which thinks at least as logically as it does. The easiest way to fool a completely logical robot is to feed it the same stimulus sequence over and over again so it gets locked into a loop. This was best demonstrated by the famous Herring Sandwich experiments conducted millennia ago at MISP-WASO, the Maxime Galon Institute of Slowly and Painfully Working Out the Surprisingly Obvious. A robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches. This was actually the most difficult part of the whole experiment. Once the robot had been programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches, a herring sandwich was placed in front of it, whereupon the robot thought to itself, ah, a herring sandwich, I like herring sandwiches. It would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich in its herring sandwich scoop, and then straighten up again. Unfortunately for the robot, it was fashioned in such a way that the action of straightening up caused the herring sandwich to slip straight back off its herring sandwich scoop and fall onto the ground in front of the robot, whereupon the robot thought to itself, ah, a herring sandwich, etc., and repeated the same action over and over and over again. The only thing that prevented the herring sandwich from getting bored of the whole damn business and crawling off in search of other ways of passing the time was that the herring sandwich, being just a bit of dead fish between a couple of slices of bread, was marginally less alert to what was going on than was the robot. The scientists at the institute thus discovered the driving force behind all change, development, and innovation in life, which was this, herring sandwiches. They published a paper to this effect, which was widely criticized as being extremely stupid. They checked their figures and realized that what they had actually discovered was boredom, or rather the practical function of boredom. In a fever of excitement, they then went on to discover other emotions like irritability, depression, reluctance, ickiness, and so on. The next breakthrough came when they stopped using herring sandwiches, whereupon a whole welter of new emotions suddenly became available to them for study, such as relief, joy, friskiness, appetite, satisfaction, and most important of all, the desire for happiness. This was the biggest breakthrough of all. Vast wodges of complex computer code governing robot behavior in all possible contingencies could be replaced very simply. All that robots needed was the capacity to be either bored or happy, and a few conditions that needed to be satisfied in order to bring those states about. They would then work out the rest for themselves. The robot which Ford had got trapped under his towel was not, at the moment, a happy robot. It was happy when it could move about. It was happy when it could see other things. It was particularly happy when it could see other things moving about, particularly if the other things were moving about doing things they shouldn't do, because then it could, with considerable delight, report them. Ford would soon fix that. He squatted over the robot and held it between his knees. The towel was still covering all of its sensory mechanisms, but Ford had now got its logic circuits exposed. The robot was whirring grungily and pettishly, but it could only fidget. It couldn't actually move. Using the prizing tool, Ford eased a small chip out from its socket. As soon as it came out, the robot suddenly went quiet and just sat there in a coma. The chip Ford had taken out was the one which contained the instructions for all the conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for the robot to feel happy. The robot would be happy when a tiny electrical charge from a point just to the left of the chip reached another point just to the right of the chip. The chip determined whether the charge got there or not. Ford pulled out a small length of wire that had been threaded into the towel. He dug one end of it into the top left hole of the chip socket and the other into the bottom right hole. That was all it took. Now the robot would be happy whatever happened. Ford quickly stood up and whisked the towel away. The robot rose ecstatically into the air, pursuing a kind of wriggly path. It turned and saw Ford. Mr. Prefect, I'm so happy to see you. Good to see you, little fellow, said Ford. The robot rapidly reported back to its central control that everything was now for the best in this best of all possible worlds, and the alarms rapidly quelled themselves and life returned to normal. At least almost to normal. There was something odd about the place. The little robot was gurgling with electric delight. Ford hurried on down the corridor, letting the thing bob along in his wake, telling him how delicious everything was, how happy it was to be able to tell him that. Ford, however, was not happy. He passed the faces of people he didn't know. They didn't look like his sort of people. They were too well-groomed. Their eyes were too dead. Every time he thought he saw someone he recognised in the distance and hired along to say hello, it would turn out to be someone else, with an altogether neater hairstyle and a much more thrusting, purposeful look than—well, than anybody Ford knew. A staircase had been moved a few inches to the left. A ceiling had been lowered slightly. A lobby had been remodelled. All these things were not worrying in themselves, though they were a little disorienting. The thing that was worrying was the decor. It used to be brash and glitzy. Expensive, because the guide sold so well throughout the civilised and post-civilised galaxy, but expensive and fun. Wild game machines lined the corridors. Insanely painted grand pianos hung from the ceilings. Vicious sea creatures from the planet Viv reared up out of pools in tree-filled atria. Robot butlers in stupid shirts roamed the corridors, seeking whose hands they might press frothing drinks into. People used to have pet vast dragons on leads and terror-sponders on perches in their offices. People knew how to have a good time, and if they didn't there were courses they could sign up for which would put that right. There was none of that now. Someone had been through the place doing some iniquitous kind of taste-job on it. Ford turned sharply into a small alcove, cupped his hand and yanked the flying robot in with him. He squatted down and peered at the burbling Cybernaut. "'What's been happening here?' he demanded. "'Oh, just the nicest thing, sir. Just the nicest possible things. Can I sit on your lap, please?' "'No,' said Ford, brushing the thing away. It was overjoyed to be spurned in this way, and started to bob and burble and swoon. Ford grabbed it again and stuck it firmly in the air a foot in front of his face. It tried to stay where it was put, but couldn't help quivering slightly. "'Something's changed, hasn't it?' Ford hissed. "'Oh, yes,' squealed the little robot, in the most fabulous and wonderful way. I feel so good about it. "'Well, what was it like before, then?' "'Oh, scrumptious.' "'But do you like the way it's changed?' demanded Ford. "'I like everything,' moaned the robot. "'Especially when you shout at me like that. Do it again, please.' "'Just tell me what happened.' "'Oh, thank you, thank you.' Ford sighed. "'Okay, okay,' panted the robot. "'The guide has been taken over. There's a new management. It's all so gorgeous I could just melt. The old management was also fabulous, of course, though I'm not sure if I thought so at the time.' "'That was before you had a bit of wire stuck in your head,' said Ford. "'How true! How wonderfully true! How wonderfully, bubblingly, frothingly, burstingly true! What a truly ecstasy-inducingly correct observation!' "'What's happened?' insisted Ford. "'Who is this new management? When do they take over? I—' "'Never mind,' he added, as the little robot started to gibber with uncontrollable joy and rub itself against his knee. "'I'll go and find out for myself.' Ford hurled himself at the door of the Editor-in-Chief's office, tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave way, rolled rapidly across the floor to where the drinks-trolley laden with some of the galaxy's most potent and expensive beverages habitually stood, seized hold of the trolley and, using it to give himself cover, trunneled it and himself across the main exposed part of the office floor to where the valuable and extremely rude statue of Lady and the Octopus stood, and took shelter behind it. Meanwhile, the little security robot entering at chest height was suicidally delighted to draw gunfire away from Ford. That at least was the plan, and a necessary one. The current Editor-in-Chief, Stagyar Zildoggo, was a dangerously unbalanced man who took a homicidal view of contributing stuff turning up in his office without pages of fresh-proofed copy, and had a battery of laser-guided guns linked to special scanning devices in the door-frame to deter anybody who was merely bringing extremely good reasons why they hadn't written any. Thus was a high level of output maintained. Unfortunately the drinks-trolley wasn't there. Ford hurled himself desperately sideways and somersaulted towards the statue of Lady and the Octopus, which also wasn't there. He rolled and hurtled around the room in a kind of random panic, tripped, span, hit the window, which fortunately was built to withstand rocket attacks, rebounded and fell in a bruised and winded heap behind a smart grey crushed leather sofa which hadn't been there before. After a few seconds he slowly peeked up from above the top of the sofa. As well as there being no drinks-trolley and no Lady and the Octopus, there had also been a startling absence of gun-fire. He frowned. This is all utterly wrong. "'Er, Mr Prefect,' I assume,' said a voice. The voice came from a smooth-faced individual behind a large ceramotique-bonded desk. Stagia Zildoggo may well have been a hell of an individual, but no one, for a whole variety of reasons, would ever have called him smooth-faced. This was not Stagia Zildoggo. "'I assume from the manner of your entrance that you do not have any material for the guide at the moment,' said the smooth-faced individual. He was sitting with his elbows resting on the table and holding his fingertips together in a manner which inexplicably has never been made a capital offence. "'I've been busy,' said Ford, rather weakly. He staggered to his feet, brushing himself down. Then he thought, what the hell was he saying things weakly for? He had to get on top of the situation. He had to find out who the hell this person was. And he suddenly thought of a way of doing it. "'Who the hell are you?' he demanded. "'I am your new Editor-in-Chief, that is, if we decide to retain your services. My name is Van Hull.' "'Didn't put his hand out,' he just added. "'What have you done to that security robot?' The little robot was rolling very, very slowly round the ceiling and moaning quietly to itself. "'I've made it very happy,' snapped Ford. "'It's the kind of mission I have. Where's Stagia? I'm all to the point. Where's his drinks-trolley?' Mr. Zildoggo is no longer with this Organisation. His drinks-trolley is, I imagine, helping to console him for this fact. "'Organisation!' yelled Ford. "'Organisation! What a bloody stupid word for a set-up like this!' Precisely our sentiments. Understructured, over-resourced, under-managed, over-inebriated. And that,' said Hull, was just the Editor. "'I'll do the jokes,' snarled Ford. "'No,' said Hull. "'You will do the restaurant column.' He tossed a piece of plastic on to the desk in front of him. Ford did not move to pick it up. "'You what?' said Ford. "'No. Me Hull. You Prefect. You do restaurant column. Me Editor. Me sit here, tell you. You do restaurant column. You get—' "'Restaurant column!' said Ford, too bewildered to be really angry at. "'Sit down, Prefect,' said Hull. He swung round in his swivel-chair, got to his feet, and stood staring out at the tiny specks enjoying the carnival twenty-three storeys below. "'Time to get this business on its feet, Prefect,' he snapped. "'We at Infinidim Enterprises are—' "'You at what?' "'Infinidim Enterprises. We have bought out the guide.' "'Infinidim?' "'We've spent millions on that name, Prefect. Start liking it, or start packing.' Ford shrugged. He had nothing to pack. "'Galaxy is changing,' said Hull. "'We've got to change with it. Go with the market. The market is moving up. New aspirations, new technology. The future is—' "'Don't tell me about the future,' said Ford. "'I've been all over the future. Spend half my time there. It's the same as anywhere else. Any when else. Whatever. Just the same old stuff in faster cars and smellier air.' "'That's one future,' said Hull. "'That's your future, if you accept it. You've got to learn to think multidimensionally. "'There are limitless futures stretching out in every direction from this moment, and from this moment, and from this. Billions of them bifurcating every instant. Every possible position of every possible electron balloons out into billions of probabilities. Billions and billions of shining, gleaming futures. You know what that means?' "'You're dribbling down your chin.' "'Billions and billions of markets.' "'I see,' said Ford. "'So you sell billions and billions of guides?' "'No,' said Hull, reaching out for his handkerchief and not finding one. "'Excuse me,' he said, but this gets me so excited.' Ford handed him his towel. "'The reason we don't sell billions and billions of guides,' continued Hull, after wiping his mouth, "'is the expense. What we do is we sell one guide billions and billions of times. "'We exploit the multidimensional nature of the universe to cut down on manufacturing costs, "'and we don't sell to penniless hitchhikers.' "'What a stupid notion that was. "'Find the one section of the market that more or less by definition doesn't have any money "'and try to sell to it. "'No, we sell to the affluent business traveller and his vacationing wife "'in a billion billion different futures. "'This is the most radical, dynamic and thrusting business venture "'in the entire multidimensional infinity of space-time probability ever.' "'You want me to be its restaurant critic?' said Ford. "'We would value your input.' "'Kill!' shouted Ford. "'He shouted it at his towel. "'The towel leapt up out of Hull's hands. "'This was not because it had any motive force of its own, "'but because Hull was so startled at the idea that it might. "'The next thing that startled him was the sight of Ford Prefett "'hurtling across the desk at him, fists first. "'In fact, Ford was just lunging for the credit card. "'But you don't get to occupy the sort of position that Hull occupied "'and the sort of organisation in which Hull occupied it "'without developing a healthily paranoid view of life.' "'He took the sensible precaution of hurling himself backwards "'and striking his head a sharp blow on the rocket-proof glass, "'then subsided into a series of worrying and highly personal dreams. "'Ford lay on the desk, surprised at how swimmingly everything had gone. "'He glanced quickly at the piece of plastic he now held in his hand. "'It was a dino-charge credit card, with his name already embossed on it, "'and an expiry date two years from now, "'and was possibly the single most exciting thing "'Ford had ever seen in his life. "'Then he clambered over the desk to see to Hull. "'He was breathing fairly easily. "'It occurred to Ford that he might breathe more easily yet "'without the weight of his wallet bearing down on his chest, "'so he slipped it out of Hull's breast pocket and flipped through it. "'Fair amounts of cash, credit tokens, "'Ultra Golf Club membership, other club memberships, "'photos of someone's wife and family, "'presumably Hull's, but it was hard to be sure these days. "'Busy executives often didn't have time for a full-time wife and family "'and would just rent them for weekends. Ha!' "'He couldn't believe what he'd just found. "'He slowly drew out from the wallet "'a single and insanely exciting piece of plastic "'that was nestling amongst a bunch of receipts. "'It wasn't insanely exciting to look at. "'It was rather dull, in fact. "'It was smaller and a little thicker than a credit card, "'and semi-transparent. "'If you held it up to the light, "'you could see a lot of holographically encoded information and images "'buried pseudo-inches deep beneath its surface. "'It was an identi-ese, "'and it was a very naughty and silly thing for Hull "'to have lying around in his wallet, "'though it was perfectly understandable. "'There were so many different ways "'in which you were required to provide absolute proof "'of your identity these days "'that life could easily become extremely tiresome "'just from that factor alone, "'never mind the deeper existential problems "'of trying to function as a coherent consciousness "'in an epistemologically ambiguous physical universe. "'Just look at cash-point machines, for instance. "'Queues of people standing around "'waiting to have their fingerprints read, "'their retinas scanned, "'bits of skin scraped from the nape of the neck, "'and undergoing instant, or nearly instant, "'a good six or seven seconds in tedious reality, "'genetic analysis. "'Then having to answer trick questions "'about members of their family they didn't even remember they had, "'and about their recorded preferences for tablecloth colours. "'And that was just to get a bit of spare cash for the weekend. "'If you were trying to raise a loan for a jet car, "'sign a missile treaty, or pay an entire restaurant bill, "'things could get really trying. "'Hence the identi-ese. "'This encoded every single piece of information "'about you, your body, and your life "'into one all-purpose machine-readable card "'that you could then carry around in your wallet, "'and therefore represented technology's greatest triumph to date "'over both itself and plain common sense.' "'Ford pocketed it. "'A remarkably good idea had just occurred to him. "'He wondered how long Hull would remain unconscious. "'Hey!' he shouted to the little melon-sized robot, "'still slobbering with euphoria out on the ceiling. "'You want to stay happy?' "'The robot gurgled that it did. "'Then stick with me and do everything I tell you without fail.' "'The robot said it was quite happy where it was up on the ceiling, "'thank you very much. "'It had never realised before how much sheer titillation "'there was to be got from a good ceiling, "'and it wanted to explore its feelings about ceilings in greater depth. "'You stay there,' said Ford, "'and you'll soon be recaptured and have your conditional chip replaced. "'You want to stay happy, come now.' "'The robot let out a long, heartfelt sigh of impassioned tristesse "'and sank reluctantly away from the ceiling. "'Listen,' said Ford, "'can you keep the rest of the security system happy for a few minutes?' "'One of the joys of true happiness,' trilled the robot, "'is sharing. "'I brim, I froth, I overflow with—' "'OK,' said Ford, "'just spread a little happiness around the security network. "'Don't give it any information. "'Just make it feel good so it doesn't feel the need to ask for any.' He picked up his towel and ran cheerfully for the door. Life had been a little dull of late. It showed every sign now of becoming extremely fruity.
 Into the well-kempt grounds that lay just on the outskirts of a well-kempt village on the fringes of the well-kempt Cotswolds turned a less-than-well-kempt car. It was a battered yellow Citroen II.C.V., which had had one careful owner, but also three suicidally reckless ones. It made its way up the driveway with a reluctant air, as if all it asked for from life was to be tipped into a restful ditch in one of the adjoining meadows, and there allowed to settle in graceful abandonment, instead of which here it was being asked to drag itself all the way up this long, graveled drive, which it would no doubt soon be called upon to drag itself all the way back down again, to what possible purpose it was beyond its wit to imagine. It drew to a halt in front of the elegant stone entrance to the main building, and then began to trundle slowly backwards again, until its occupant yanked on the handbrake, which evoked from the car a sort of strangled eek. A door flopped open, wobbling perilously on its one remaining hinge, and there emerged from the car a pair of the sort of legs which soundtrack editors are unable to see without needing to slap a smoky saxophone solo all over it, for reasons which no one besides soundtrack editors has ever been able to understand. The owner of the legs followed them in the usual manner, closed the car door tenderly, and then made her way into the building. The car remained parked in front of it. After a few minutes a porter came out and examined it, adopted a disapproving manner, and then, for lack of anything more positive to do, went back in. A short time later Kate was shown into the office of Mr. Ralph Standish, the chief consultant psychologist, and one of the directors of the Woods Head Hospital, who was just completing a telephone conversation. "'Yes, it is true,' he was saying, 'that sometimes unusually intelligent and sensitive children can appear to be stupid, but, Mrs. Benson, stupid children can sometimes appear to be stupid as well. I think that's something you might have to consider. I know it's very painful. Yes. Good day, Mrs. Benson.' He put the phone away into a desk drawer, and spent a couple of seconds collecting his thoughts before looking up. "'This is very short notice, Miss, er, Schechter,' he said to her at last. In fact what he said was, "'This is very short notice, Miss, er,' and then he had paused and peered into another of his desk drawers before saying, Schechter. It seemed to Kate that it was very odd to keep your visitors' names in a drawer, but then he clearly disliked having things cluttering up his fine but severely designed black-ash desk, because there was nothing on it at all. It was completely blank, as was every other surface in his office. There was nothing on the small neat steel-and-glass coffee-table which sat squarely between two Barcelona chairs. There was nothing on top of the two expensive-looking filing cabinets which stood at the back of the room. There were no bookshelves. If there were any books they were presumably hidden away behind the white doors of the large blank built-in cupboards, and although there was one plain black picture-frame hanging on the wall, this was presumably a temporary aberration, because there was no picture in it. Kate looked around her with a bemused air. "'Do you have no ornaments in here at all, Mr. Standish?' she asked. He was for a moment somewhat taken aback by her transatlantic directness, but then answered her. "'Indeed I have ornaments,' he said, and pulled open another drawer. He pulled out from this a small china model of a kitten playing with a ball of wool, and put it firmly on the desk in front of him. "'As a psychologist I am aware of the important role that ornamentation plays in nourishing the human spirit,' he pronounced. He put the china kitten back in the drawer and slid it closed with a smooth click. "'Now,' he clasped his hands together on the desk in front of him, and looked at her inquiringly, "'it's very good of you to see me at short notice, Mr. Standish. Yes, yes, we've established that, but I'm sure you know what newspaper deadlines are like. I know at least as much as I would ever care to know about newspapers, Miss—' He opened his drawer again. "'Miss Schechter, but—' "'Well, that's partly what made me approach you,' lied Kate charmingly. "'I know that you have suffered from some, well, unfortunate publicity here, and thought you might welcome the opportunity to talk about some of the more enlightening aspects of the work of the Woods Head Hospital.' She smiled very sweetly. "'It's only because you come to me with the highest recommendation from my very good friend and colleague, Mr—' "'Er—' "'Er—Franklin—Alan Franklin,' prompted Kate, to save the psychologist from having to open his drawer again. Alan Franklin was a therapist whom Kate had seen for a few sessions after the loss of her husband, Luke. He had warned her that Standish, though brilliant, was also peculiar, even by the high standards set by his profession. "'Er—Franklin,' resumed Standish, "'but I agreed to see you. Let me warn you instantly that if I see any resumption of this something nasty in the Woods Head mendacity appearing in the papers as a result of this interview, I will—I will—' "'Do such things what they are yet I know not, but they shall be the terror of the earth,' said Kate brightly. Standish narrowed his eyes. "'Lear, Act 2, Scene 4,' he said, "'and I think you'll find it's terrorism, not terror.' "'Do you know I think you're right?' replied Kate. "'Thank you, Alan,' she thought. She smiled at Standish, who relaxed into pleased superiority. It was odd,' Kate reflected, "'that people who needed to bully you were the easiest to push around.' "'So you would like to know precisely what, Miss Schechter?' "'Assume,' said Kate, "'that I know nothing.' Standish smiled as if to signify that no assumption could possibly give him greater pleasure. "'Very well,' he said. "'The Woods Head is a research hospital. We specialise in the care and study of patients with unusual or previously unknown conditions largely in the psychological or psychiatric fields. "'Funds are raised in various ways. One of our chief methods is quite simply to take in private patients at exorbitantly high fees, which they are happy to pay, or at least happy to complain about. There is, in fact, nothing to complain about, because patients who come to us privately are made fully aware of why our fees are so high. For the money they are paying they are, of course, perfectly entitled to complain. The right to complain is one of the privileges they are paying for. In some cases we come to a special arrangement under which, in return for being made the sole beneficiaries of a patient's estate, we will guarantee to look after that patient for the rest of his or her life.'" "'So, in effect, you are in the business of giving scholarships to people with particularly gifted diseases?' "'Exactly. A very good way of expressing it. We are in the business of giving scholarships to people with particularly gifted diseases. I must make a note of that. Miss Mayhew—' He had opened a drawer which clearly contained his office intercom. In response to his summons one of the cupboards opened, and turned out to be a door into a side office—a feature which must have appealed to some architect who had conceived an ideological dislike of doors. From this office there emerged obediently a thin and rather blank-faced woman in her mid-forties. "'Miss Mayhew,' said Mr. Standish, ''we are in the business of giving scholarships to people with particularly gifted diseases.' "'Very good, Mr. Standish,' said Miss Mayhew, and retreated backwards into her office, pulling the door closed after her. Kate wondered if it was perhaps a cupboard after all. "'And we do have some patients with some really quite outstanding diseases at the moment, enthused the psychologist. Perhaps you would care to come and see one or two of our current stars?' "'Indeed I would. That would be most interesting, Mr. Standish. You are very kind,' said Kate. "'You have to be kind in this job,' Standish replied, and flicked a smile on and off at her. Kate was trying to keep some of the impatience she was feeling out of her manner. She did not take to Mr. Standish, and was beginning to feel that there was a kind of Martian quality to him. Furthermore, the only thing she was actually interested in was discovering whether or not the hospital had accepted a new admission in the early hours of the morning, and if so, where he was, and whether she could see him. She had originally tried the direct approach, but had been rebuffed by a mere telephone receptionist, on the grounds that she didn't have a name to ask for. Simply asking if they had any tall, well-built, blonde men in residence had seemed to create entirely the wrong impression. At least she insisted to herself that it was entirely the wrong impression. A quick phone call to Alan Franklin had set her up for this altogether more subtle approach. "'Good!' A look of doubt passed momentarily over Mr. Standish's face, and he summoned Miss Mayhew from out of her cupboard again. "'Er, Miss Mayhew, that last thing I just said to you—' "'Yes, Mr. Standish. I assume you realise that I wish you to make a note of it for me?' "'No, Mr. Standish, but I will be happy to do so.' "'Thank you,' said Mr. Standish, with a slightly tense look. "'And tidy up in here, please. The place looks a—' He wanted to say that the place looked a mess, but was frustrated by its air of clinical sterility. "'Er, just tidy up generally,' he concluded. "'Yes, Mr. Standish.' The psychologist nodded tersely, brushed a non-existent speck of dust off the top of his desk, flicked another brief smile on and off at Kate, and then escorted her out of his office and into the corridor, which was immaculately laid out with the sort of beige carpet which gave everyone who walked on it electric shocks. "'Here, you see,' said Standish, indicating part of the wall they were walking past with an idle wave of his hand, but not making it in any way clear what it was he wished her to see or what she was supposed to understand from it. "'And this,' he said, apparently pointing at a door-hinge. "'Ah!' he added, as the door swung open towards them. Kate was alarmed to find herself giving a little expectant start every time a door opened anywhere in this place. This was not the sort of behaviour she expected of a worldly-wise New Yorker journalist, even if she didn't actually live in New York, and only wrote travel articles for magazines. It was still not right for her to be looking for large blonde men every time a door opened. There was no large blonde man. There was instead a small, sandy-haired girl of about ten years old, being pushed along in a wheelchair. She seemed very pale, sick, and withdrawn, and was murmuring something soundlessly to herself. Whatever it was she was murmuring seemed to cause her worry and agitation, and she would flop this way and then that in her chair, as if trying to escape from the words coming out of her mouth. Kate was instantly moved by the sight of her, and on an impulse asked the nurse who was pushing her along to stop. She squatted down to look kindly into the girl's face, which seemed to please the nurse a little, but Mr. Standish less so. Kate did not try to demand the girl's attention, merely gave her an open and friendly smile to see if she wanted to respond. But the girl seemed unwilling or unable to. Her mouth worked away endlessly, appearing almost to lead an existence that was independent of the rest of her face. Now that Kate looked at her more closely, it seemed that she looked not so much sick and withdrawn as weary, harassed, and unutterably fed up. She needed a little rest, she needed peace, but her mouth kept motoring on. For a fleeting instant her eyes caught Kate's, and the message Kate received was along the lines of, I'm sorry, but you'll just have to excuse me while all this is going on. The girl took a deep breath, half closed her eyes in resignation, and continued her relentless silent murmuring. Kate leant forward a little in an attempt to catch any actual words, but she couldn't make anything out. She shot an inquiring look up at Standish. He said simply, Stock-market prices. A look of amazement crept over Kate's face. Standish added with a wry shrug, Yesterday's, I'm afraid. Kate flinched at having her reaction so wildly misinterpreted, and hurriedly looked back at the girl in order to cover her confusion. I mean, she said rather redundantly, She's just sitting here reciting yesterday's stock-market prices? The girl rolled her eyes past Kate's. Yes, said Standish. It took a lip-reader to work out what was going on. We all got rather excited, of course, but then closer examination revealed they were in yesterday's, which is a bit of a disappointment. Not that significant a case, really. Aberrant behaviour. Interesting to know why she does it, but— Hold on a moment, said Kate, trying to sound very interested rather than absolutely horrified. Are you saying that she is reciting, what, the closing prices over and over, or— No. That's an interesting feature, of course. She pretty much keeps pace with the movements in the market over the course of a whole day, just twenty-four hours out of step. But that's extraordinary, isn't it? Oh, yes, quite a feat. A feat? Well, as a scientist, I have to take the view that, since the information is freely available, she is acquiring it through normal channels. There's no necessity in this case to invent any supernatural or paranormal dimension. Hockham's razor. Shouldn't needlessly multiply entities. But has anyone seen her studying the newspapers or copying stuff down over the phone? She looked up at the nurse, who shook her head dumbly. No, never actually caught her at it, said Standish. As I say, it's quite a feat. I'm sure a stage magician or memory man could tell you how it was done. Have you asked one? No, don't hold her to such people. But do you really think she could possibly be doing this deliberately? insisted Kate. Believe me, if you understood as much about people as I do, Miss—er—er—you would believe anything, said Standish, in his most professionally reassuring turn of voice. Kate stared into the tired, wretched face of the young girl and said nothing. You have to understand, said Standish, that we have to be rational about this. If it was to-morrow's stock-market prices, it would be a different story. That would be a phenomenon of an entirely different character, which would merit and demand the most rigorous study, and I'm sure we'd have no difficulty in funding the research. There would be absolutely no problem about that. I see, said Kate, and meant it. She stood up a little stiffly and brushed down her skirt. So, she said, and she felt ashamed of herself, um, who is your newest patient? Who has arrived most recently, then? She shuddered at the crassness of the nurse-equitor, but reminded herself that she was there as a journalist, so it would not seem odd. Standish waved the nurse and the wheelchair with its sad charge on their way. Kate glanced back at the girl once, and then followed Standish through the swing doors and into the next section of corridor, which was identical to the previous one. Here, you see, said Standish again, this time apparently in relation to a window-frame. And this, he said, pointing at a light. He had obviously either not heard her question, or was deliberately ignoring it. Perhaps, thought Kate, he was simply treating it with the contempt it deserved. It suddenly dawned on her what all this here, you see, and and thising was about. He was asking her to admire the quality of the decor. The windows were sashes, with finely made and beautifully painted beads. The light-fittings were of a heavy dull metal, probably nickel-plated, and so on. Very fine, she said accommodatingly. Nice place you've got here, she added, thinking that that would please him. It did. He allowed himself a subdued beam of pleasure. We like to think of it as a quality caring environment, he said. You must get a lot of people wanting to come here, Kate continued, plugging away at her theme. How often do you admit new patients? When was the last? With her left hand she carefully restrained her right hand, which wanted to strangle her at this moment. A door they were passing was slightly ajar, and she tried unobtrusively to look in. Very well, we'll take a look in here, said Standish immediately, pushing the door fully open on what transpired to be quite a small room. Ah, yes, Standish said, recognizing the occupant. He ushered Kate in. The occupant of the room was another non-large, non-blonde person. Kate was beginning to find the whole visit to be something of an emotionally wearing experience, and she had a feeling that things were not about to ease up in that respect. The man sitting in the bedside chair, while his bed was being made up by a hospital orderly, was one of the most deeply and disturbingly tousled people that Kate had ever seen. In fact, it was only his hair that was tousled, for it was tousled to such an extreme degree that it seemed to draw all of his long face up into its distressed chaos. He seemed quite content to sit where he was, but there was something tremendously vacant about his contentedness. He seemed literally to be content about nothing. There was a completely empty space hanging in the air about eighteen inches in front of his face, and his contentedness, if it sprang from anything, sprang from staring at that. There was also a sense that he was waiting for something. Whether it was something that was about to happen at any moment, or something that was going to happen later in the week, or even something that was going to happen some little while after hell iced over and British Telecom got the phones fixed, was by no means apparent, because it seemed to be all the same to him. If it happened he was ready for it, and if it didn't he was content. Kate found such contentedness almost unbearably distressing. "'What's the matter with him?' she said quietly, and then instantly realized that she was talking as if he wasn't there, when he could probably speak perfectly well for himself. Indeed, at that moment he suddenly did speak. "'Oh, er, hi,' he said. "'Er, yeah, thank you.' "'Er, hello,' she said in response, though it didn't seem quite to fit, or rather what he had said didn't seem quite to fit. Standish made a gesture to her to discourage her from speaking. "'Er, yeah, a bagel would be fine,' said the contented man. He said it in a flat kind of tone, as if merely repeating something he had been given to say. "'Yeah, and maybe some juice,' he added. "'Okay, thanks.' He then relaxed into his state of empty watchfulness. "'A very unusual condition,' said Standish. "'That is to say we can only believe that it is entirely unique. I've certainly never heard of anything remotely like it. It has also proved virtually impossible to verify beyond doubt that it is what it appears to be, so I'm glad to say we've been spared the embarrassment of attempting to give the condition a name.' "'Would you like me to help Mr. Elwes back to bed?' asked the orderly of Standish. Standish nodded. He didn't bother to waste words on minions. The orderly bent down to talk to the patient. "'Mr. Elwes?' he said quietly. "'Mr. Elwes seemed to swim up out of a reverie. "'H'm?' he said, and suddenly looked around. He seemed confused. "'Oh! Oh! What?' he said faintly. "'Would you like me to help you back to bed?' "'Oh! Oh, thank you, yes. Ah, yes, that would be kind.' Though clearly dazed and bewildered, Mr. Elwes was quite able to get himself back into bed, and all the orderly needed to supply was reassurance and encouragement. Once Mr. Elwes was well settled, the orderly nodded politely to Standish and Kate, and made his exit. Mr. Elwes quickly lapsed back into his trance-like state, lying propped up against an escarpment of pillows. His head dropped forward slightly, and he stared at one of his knees, poking up bonally from under the covers. "'Get me New York,' he said. Kate shot a puzzled glance at Standish, hoping for some kind of explanation, but got none. "'Oh! Okay,' said Mr. Elwes. "'It's five-four-one-something. Hold on.' He spoke another four digits of a number in his dead-flat voice. "'What is happening here?' asked Kate at last. "'It took us rather a long time to work it out. It was only quite by the remotest chance that someone discovered it. That television was on in the room.' He pointed to the small portable set off to one side of the bed. "'Tune to one of those chat-programme things which happen to be going out live. Most extraordinary thing.' Mr. Elwes was sitting here muttering about how much he hated the BBC—don't know if it was the BBC, perhaps it was one of those other channels they have now—and was expressing an opinion about the host of the programme, to the effect that he considered him to be a rectum of some kind, and saying furthermore that he wished the whole thing was over, and that yes, all right, he was coming, and then suddenly what he was saying and what was on the television began in some extraordinary way almost to synchronise. "'I don't understand what you mean,' said Kate. "'I'd be surprised if you did,' said Standish. Everything that Elwes said was then said just a moment later on the television by a gentleman by the name of Mr. Dustin Hoffman. It seems that Mr. Elwes here knows everything that this Mr. Hoffman is going to say just a second or so before he says it. It is not, I have to say, something that Mr. Hoffman would be very pleased about if he knew. Attempts have been made to alert the gentleman to the problem, but he has proved to be somewhat difficult to reach.' "'Just what the shit is going on here?' asked Mr. Elwes placidly. "'Mr. Hoffman is, we believe, currently making a film, on location, somewhere on the West Coast of America.' He looked at his watch. "'I think he has probably just woken up in his hotel and is making his early-morning phone calls,' he added. Kate was gazing with astonishment between Standish and the extraordinary Mr. Elwes. "'How long has the poor man been like this?' "'Oh, about five years, I think. Started absolutely out of the blue. He was sitting having dinner with his family one day, as usual, when suddenly he started complaining about his caravan, and then shortly afterwards about how he was being shot. He then spent the entire night talking in his sleep, repeating the same apparently meaningless phrases over and over again, and also saying he didn't think much of the way they were written. It was a very trying time for his family, as you can imagine, living with such a perfectionist actor and not even realising it. It now seems very surprising how long it took them to identify what was occurring, particularly when he once woke them all up in the early hours of the morning to thank them and the producer and the director for his Oscar.' Kate, who didn't realise that the day was still only softening her up for what was to come, made the mistake of thinking that it had just reached a climax of shock. "'The poor man!' she said in a hushed voice. "'What a pathetic state to be in! He's just living as someone else's shadow. I don't think he's in any pain.' Mr. Elwes appeared to be quietly locked in a bitter argument which seemed to touch on the definitions of the words points, gross, profits, and limo. "'But the implications of this are extraordinary, aren't they?' said Kate. "'He's actually saying these things moments before, Dustin Hoffman?' "'Well, it's all conjecture, of course. We only got a few clear instances of absolute correlation, and we just haven't got the opportunity to do more thorough research. One has to recognise that those few instances of direct correlation were not rigorously documented and could be more simply explained as coincidence. The rest could be merely the product of an elaborate fantasy.' "'But if you put this case next to that of the girl we just saw—' "'Ah, well, you can't do that, you see. We have to judge each case on its own merits.' "'But they're both in the same world.' "'Ah, yes, but there are separate issues. Obviously if Mr. Elwes here could demonstrate significant precognition of, for instance, the head of the Soviet Union, or better still, the President of the United States, then clearly there would be important defence issues involved. And one might be prepared to stretch a point on the question of what is and what is not coincidence and fantasy. But for a mere screen actor—that is, a screen actor with no apparent designs on political office—I think that, no, we have to stick to the principles of rigorous science.' "'So,' he added, turning to leave and drawing Kate with him, "'I think that in the cases of both Mr. Elwes and—what was her name?—the charming girl in the wheelchair, it may be that we are not able to be of much more help to them, and we may need the space and facilities for more deserving cases.' Kate could think of nothing to say to this, and followed, seething dumbly. "'Ah, now here we have an altogether much more interesting and promising case,' said Standish, forging on ahead through the next set of double doors. Kate was trying to keep her reactions under control, but nevertheless even someone as glassy and Martian as Mr. Standish could not help but detect that his audience was not absolutely with him. A little extra brusqueness and impatience crept into his demeanour to join forces with the large quantities of brusqueness and impatience which were already there. They paced down the corridor for a few seconds in silence. Kate was looking for other ways of casually introducing the subject of recent admissions, but was forced to concede to herself that you cannot attempt to introduce the same subject three times in a row without beginning to lose that vital quality of casualness. She glanced as surreptitiously as she could at each door they passed, but most were firmly closed, and the ones that were not revealed nothing of interest. She glanced out of a window as they walked past it, and noticed a van turning into a rear courtyard. It caught her attention in the brief instance that it was within her view, because it very clearly wasn't a baker's van or a laundry van. Baker's vans and laundry vans advertise their business, and have words like bakery and laundry painted on them, whereas this van was completely blank. It had absolutely nothing to say to anyone, and it said it, loudly and distinctly. It was a large, heavy, serious-looking van that was almost on the verge of being an actual lorry, and it was painted in a uniform dark metallic grey. It reminded Kate of the huge gun-metal grey freight lorries which thundered through Bulgaria and Yugoslavia on their way from Albania, with nothing but the word Albania stenciled on their sides. She remembered wondering what it was that the Albanians exported in such an anonymous way, but when on one occasion she had looked it up, she found that their only export was electricity, which, if she remembered her high-school physics correctly, was unlikely to be moved around in lorries. The large, serious-looking van turned and started to reverse towards the rear entrance of the hospital. Whatever it was that the van usually carried, Kate thought, it was about either to pick it up or deliver it. She moved on. A few moments later Standish arrived at a door, knocked at it gently, and looked inquiringly into the room within. He then beckoned to Kate to follow him in. This was a room of an altogether different sort. Immediately within the door was an ante-room with a very large window, through which the main room could be seen. The two rooms were clearly sound-proofed from each other, because the ante-room was decked out with monitoring equipment and computers, not one of which but didn't hum loudly to itself, and the main room contained a woman lying in bed, asleep. Mrs. Elspeth May, said Standish, and clearly felt that he was introducing the top of the bill. Her room was obviously a very good one, spacious and furnished comfortably and expensively. Fresh flowers stood on every surface, and the bedside table on which Mrs. May's knitting lay was of mahogany. She herself was a comfortably shaped, silver-haired lady of late middle age, and she was lying asleep half propped up in bed on a pile of pillows, wearing a pink, wooly cardigan. After a moment it became clear to Kate that though she was asleep she was by no means inactive. Her head lay back peacefully, with her eyes closed, but her right hand was clutching a pen which was scribbling away furiously on a large pad of paper which lay beside her. The hand, like the wheelchair girl's mouth, seemed to lead an independent and feverishly busy existence. Some small pinkish electrodes were taped to Mrs. May's forehead just below her hairline, and Kate assumed that these were providing some of the readings which danced across the computer screens in the ante-room in which she and Standish stood. Two white-coated men and a woman stood monitoring the equipment, and a nurse stood watching through the window. Standish exchanged a couple of brief words with them on the current state of the patient, which was universally agreed to be excellent. Kate could not escape the impression that she ought to know who Mrs. May was, but she didn't, and was forced to ask. "'She's a medium,' said Standish a little crossly. "'As I assumed you would know. A medium of prodigious powers. She is currently in a trance and engaged in automatic writing. She is taking dictation. Virtually every piece of dictation she receives is of inestimable value. Have you not heard of her?' Kate admitted that she had not. "'Well, you are no doubt familiar with the lady who claimed that Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert were dictating music to her?' "'Yes, I did hear about that. There was a lot of stuff in colour supplements about her a few years ago.' "'Her claims were, well, interesting, if that's the sort of thing you're interested in. The music was certainly more consistent with what might be produced by each of those gentlemen quickly and before breakfast than it was with what you would expect from a musically unskilled middle-aged housewife.' Kate could not let this pomposity pass. "'That's a rather sexist viewpoint,' she said. George Eliot was a middle-aged housewife.' "'Yes, yes,' said Standish testily. But she wasn't taking musical dictation from the deceased Wolfgang Amadeus. That's the point I'm making. Please try and follow the logic of this argument and do not introduce irrelevances. If I felt for a moment that the example of George Eliot could shed any light on our present problem you could rely on me to introduce it myself. Where was I? I don't know. Uh, Mabel, Doris. What was her name? Let us call her Mabel. The point is that the easiest way of dealing with the Doris problem was simply to ignore it. Nothing very important hinged on it at all. A few concerts, second-rate material. But here, here, we have something of an altogether different nature.' He said this last in hushed tones, and turned to study a TV monitor which stood among the bank of computer screens. It showed a close-up of Mrs. May's hand scuttling across a pad of paper. Her hand largely obscured what she had written, but it appeared to be mathematics of some kind. Mrs. May is, or so she claims, taking dictation from some of the greatest physicists, from Einstein and from Heisenberg and Planck. And it is very hard to dispute her claims, because the information being produced here by automatic writing by this, uh, untutored lady is in fact physics of a very profound order. From the late Einstein we are getting more and more refinements to our picture of how time and space work at a macroscopic level, and from the late Heisenberg and Planck we are increasing our understanding of the fundamental structures of matter at a quantum level. And there is absolutely no doubt that this information is edging us closer and closer towards the elusive goal of a grand unified field theory of everything. Now this produces a very interesting, not to say somewhat embarrassing, situation for scientists, because the means by which the information is reaching us seems to be completely contrary to the meaning of the information. It's like Uncle Henry, said Kate suddenly. Standish looked at her blankly. Uncle Henry thinks he's a chicken, Kate explained. Standish looked at her blankly again. You must have heard it, said Kate. We're terribly worried about Uncle Henry. He thinks he's a chicken. Well, why don't you send him to the doctor? Well we would, only we need the eggs. Standish looked at her as if a small but perfectly formed elderberry tree had suddenly sprung unbidden from the bridge of her nose. Say that again, he said in a small shocked voice. What, all of it? All of it. Kate stuck her fist on her hip and said it again, doing the voices with a bit more dash and southern accents this time. That's brilliant, Standish breathed when she had done. You must have heard it before, she said, a little surprised by this response. It's an old joke. No, he said, I have not. We need the eggs. We need the eggs. We need the eggs. We can't send him to the doctor because we need the eggs. An astounding insight into the central paradoxes of the human condition and of our indefatigable facility for constructing adaptive rationales to account for it. Good God! Kate shrugged. And you say this is a joke? demanded Standish incredulously. Yes, it's very old, really. And are they all like that? I never realized. Well, I'm astounded, said Standish, utterly astounded. I thought the jokes were things that fat people said on television. I never listen to them. I feel that people have been keeping something from me. Nurse! The nurse, who had been keeping watch on Mrs. May through the window, jumped at being barked at unexpectedly like this. Yes, Mr. Standish, she said. He clearly made her nervous. Why have you never told me any jokes? The nurse stared at him and quivered at the impossibility of even knowing how to think about answering such a question. Uh, well, make a note of it, will you? In future I will require you and all other staff in this hospital to tell me all the jokes you have at your disposal. Is that understood? Uh, yes, Mr. Standish. Standish looked at her with doubt and suspicion. You do know some jokes, do you, nurse? he challenged her. Uh, yes, Mr. Standish, I think, yes, I do. Tell me one. What, uh, now, Mr. Standish? This instant. Uh, well, um, there's one which is that a patient wakes up after having, well, that is, he's been to, uh, to surgery, and he wakes up and it's not very good, but anyway he's been to surgery and he says to the doctor when he wakes up, Doctor, doctor, what's wrong with me? I can't feel my legs. And the doctor says, Yes, I'm afraid we've had to amputate both your arms. And that's it, really. Um, that's why he couldn't feel his legs, you see. Mr. Standish looked at her levelly for a moment or two. You're on report, nurse, he said. Uh, yes, Mr. Standish. He turned to Kate. Isn't there one about a chicken crossing a road or some such thing? Uh, yes, said Kate doubtfully. She felt she was caught in a bit of a situation here. And how does that one go? Well, said Kate, it goes, why did the chicken cross the road? Yes, and? And the answer is, to get to the other side. I see. Standish considered things for a moment. And what does this chicken do when it arrives at the other side of the road? History does not relate, replied Kate promptly. I think that falls outside the scope of the joke, which really only concerns itself with the journey of the chicken across the road and the chicken's reasons for making it. It's a little like a Japanese haiku in that respect. Kate suddenly found she was enjoying herself. She managed to wink surreptitiously at the nurse, who had no idea what to make of anything at all. I see, said Standish once again, and frowned. And do these, uh, jokes require the preparatory use of any form of artificial stimulant? It depends on the joke. Depends on who it's being told to. Hmm. Well, I must say, you've certainly opened up a rich furrow for me, Miss, uh, uh, it seems to me that the whole field of humour could benefit from close and immediate scrutiny. Clearly we need to sort out the jokes which have any kind of genuine psychological value from those which are merely encouraged drug abuse and should be stopped. Good. He turned to address the white-coated researcher, who was studying the TV monitor on which Mrs. May's scribblings were being tracked. Anything fresh of value for Mr. Einstein? he asked. The researcher did not move his eyes from the screen. He replied, It says, How would you like your eggs, poached or boiled? Again Standish paused. Interesting, he said, very interesting. Continue to make a careful note of everything she writes. Come. This last he said to Kate, and made his way out of the room. Very strange people, physicists, he said, as soon as they were outside again. In my experience the ones who aren't actually dead are in some way very ill. Well, the afternoon presses on, and I'm sure that you're keen to get away and write your article, Miss, uh, uh, I certainly have things urgently awaiting my attention, and patients awaiting my care. So, if you have no more questions— Uh, there is just one thing, Mr. Standish—Kate decided to hell with it—we need to emphasize that it's up to the minute. Perhaps if you could spare a couple more minutes we could go and see whoever is your most recent admission. Uh, I think that'd be a little tricky. Our last admission was about a month ago, and she died of pneumonia two weeks after admission. Oh, ah, well, perhaps that isn't so thrilling. So, no new admissions in the last couple of days? No admissions of anyone particularly large or blonde or Nordic, with a fur coat or a sledgehammer, perhaps? I mean, just for instance? An inspiration-strucker? A readmission, perhaps? Standish regarded her with deepening suspicion. Miss, uh— Miss Schechter. Miss Schechter, I begin to get the impression that your interests in the hospital are not— He was interrupted at that moment by the swing doors just behind them in the corridor being pushed open. He looked up to see who it was, and as he did so his manner changed. He motioned Kate sharply to stand aside while a large trolley-bed was wheeled through the doors by an orderly. A sister and another nurse followed in attendance, and gave the impression that they were an entourage in a procession, rather than merely nurses about their normal business. The occupant of the trolley was a delicately frail old man, with skin like finely-veined parchment. The rear section of the trolley was inclined upwards at a very slight angle, so that the old man could survey the world as it passed him. And he surveyed it with a kind of quiet benevolent horror. His mouth hung open gently, and his head lolled very slightly, so that every slightest bump in the progress of the trolley caused it to roll a little to one side or the other. Yet in spite of his fragile listlessness, the air he emanated was that of very quietly, very gently, owning everything. It was the one eye which conveyed this. Each thing it rested on, whether it was the view through a window, or the nurse who was holding back the door so that the trolley could move through it without impediment, or whether it was on Mr. Standish, who suddenly was all obsequious charm and obeisance, all seemed instantly gathered up into the domain ruled by that eye. Kate wondered for a moment how it was that eyes conveyed such an immense amount of information about their owners. They were, after all, merely spheres of white gristle. They hardly changed as they got older, apart from getting a little redder and a bit runnier. The iris opened and closed a bit, but that was all. Where did all this flood of information come from, particularly in the case of a man with only one of them, and only a sealed-up flap of skin in place of the other? She was interrupted in this line of thought by the fact that at that instant the eye in question moved on from Standish and settled on her. The grip it exerted was so startling that she almost yelped. With the frailest of faint motions the old man signalled to the orderly who was pushing the trolley to pause. The trolley drew to a halt, and when the noise of its rolling wheels was stilled there was for a moment no other noise to be heard other than the distant hum of an elevator. Then the elevator stopped. Kate returned his look with a little smiling frown, as if to say, Sorry, do I know you? and then wondered to herself if in fact she did. There was some fleeting familiarity about his face, but she couldn't quite catch it. She was impressed to notice that though this was only a trolley-bed he was in, the bed-linen that his hands lay on was real linen, freshly laundered and ironed. Mr. Standish coughed slightly and said, Miss, uh, uh, this is one of our most valued and cherished patients, Mr.— Are you quite comfortable, Mr. Odwin? interrupted the sister helpfully, but there was no need. This was one patient whose name Standish most certainly knew. Odin quieted her with the slightest of gestures. Mr. Odwin, said Standish, this is Miss, uh— Kate was about to introduce herself once more, when she was suddenly taken completely by surprise. I know exactly who she is, said Odin, in a quiet but distinct voice, and there was in his eye for a moment the sense of an aerosol looking meaningfully at a wasp. She tried to be very formal and English. I'm afraid, she said stiffly, that you have the advantage of me. Yes, said Odin. He gestured to the orderly, and together they resumed their leisurely passage down the corridor. Glances were exchanged between Standish and the sister, and then Kate was startled to notice that there was someone else standing in the corridor there with them. He had not presumably appeared there by magic. He had merely stood still when the trolley moved on, and his height, or rather his lack of it, was such that he had simply hitherto been hidden behind it. Things had been much better when he had been hidden. There are some people you like immediately, some whom you think you might learn to like in the fullness of time, and some that you simply want to push away from you with a sharp stick. The next thing was instantly apparent, into which category for Kate the person of Torag fell. He grinned and stared at her, or rather appeared to stare at some invisible fly darting around her head. He ran up, and before she could prevent him, grabbed hold of her right hand in his, and shook it wildly up and down. I, too, have the advantage of you, Miss Schechter, he said, and gleefully skipped away up the corridor.
 The usual people tried to claim responsibility. First the IRA, then the PLO and the Gas Board. Even British Nuclear Fuels rushed out a statement to the effect that the situation was completely under control, that it was a one-in-a-million chance, that there was hardly any radioactive leakage at all, and that the site of the explosion would make a nicer location for a day out with the kids and a picnic, before finally having to admit that it wasn't actually anything to do with them at all. No cause could be found for the explosion. It seemed to have happened spontaneously, and of its own free will. Explanations were advanced, but most of these were simply phrases which restated the problem in different words, along the same principles which had given the world metal fatigue. In fact, a very similar phrase was invented to account for the sudden transition of wood, metal, plastic and concrete into an explosive condition, which was non-linear catastrophic structural exasperation. Or to put it another way, as a junior cabinet minister did on television the following night, in a phrase which was to haunt the rest of his career, the check-in desk had just got fundamentally fed up with being where it was. As in all such disastrous events, estimates of the casualties varied wildly. They started at 47 dead, 89 seriously injured, went up to 63 dead, 130 injured, and rose as high as 117 dead before the figures started to be revised downward once more. The final figures revealed that, once all the people who could be accounted for had been accounted for, in fact no one had been killed at all. A small number of people were in hospital suffering from cuts and bruises and varying degrees of traumatized shock, but that, unless anyone had any information about anybody actually being missing, was that. This was yet another inexplicable aspect of the whole affair. The force of the explosion had been enough to reduce a large part of the front of Terminal 2 to rubble, and yet everyone inside the building had somehow either fallen very luckily, or been shielded from one piece of falling masonry by another, or had the shock of the explosion absorbed by their luggage. All in all very little luggage had survived at all. There were questions asked in Parliament about this, but not very interesting ones. It was a couple of days before Kate Schechter became aware of any of these things, or indeed of anything at all in the outside world. She passed the time quietly in a world of her own, in which she was surrounded, as far as the eye could see, with old cabin trunks full of past memories, in which she rummaged with great curiosity and sometimes bewilderment. Or at least about a tenth of the cabin trunks were full of vivid and often painful or uncomfortable memories of her past life. The other nine-tenths were full of penguins, which surprised her. In so far as she recognized at all that she was dreaming, she realized that she must be exploring her own subconscious mind. She had heard it said that human beings are supposed only to use about a tenth of their brains, and that no one was very clear what the other nine-tenths were for, but she had certainly never heard it suggested that they were used for storing penguins. Gradually the trunks, the memories, and the penguins began to grow indistinct, to become all white and swimmy, then to become like walls that were all white and swimmy, and finally to become walls that were merely white, or rather a yellowish-greenish kind of off-white, and to enclose her in a small room. The room was in semi-darkness. A bedside light was on, but turned down low, and the light from a street lamp found its way between the grey curtains and through sodium patterns on the opposite wall. She became dimly aware of the shadowed shape of her own body lying under the white turn-down sheet and the pale, neat blankets. She stared at it for a nervous while, checking that it looked all right before she tried tentatively to move any part of it. She tried her right hand, and that seemed to be fine, a little stiff and aching, but the fingers all responded, and all seemed to be of the right length and thickness, and to bend in the right places and in the right directions. She panicked briefly when she couldn't immediately locate her left hand, but then she found it lying across her stomach and nagging at her in some odd way. It took her a second or two of concentration to put together a number of rather disturbing feelings, and realise that there was a needle bandaged into her arm. This shook her quite badly. From the needle there snaked a long, thin, transparent pipe that glistened yellowly in the light from the street lamp, and hung in a gentle curl from a thick plastic bag suspended from a tall metal stand. An array of horrors briefly assailed her in respect of this apparatus, but she peered dimly at the bag and saw the words DEXTRASALINE. She made herself calm down again, and lay quietly for a few moments before continuing her exploration. Her ribcage seemed undamaged, bruised and tender, but there was no sharper pain anywhere to suggest that anything was broken. Her hips and thighs ached and were stiff, but revealed no serious hurt. She flexed the muscles down her right leg and then her left. She rather fancied that her left ankle was sprained. In other words, she told herself, she was perfectly all right. So what was she doing here, in what she could tell from the septic colour of the paint, was clearly a hospital. She sat up impatiently, and immediately rejoined the penguins for an entertaining few minutes. The next time she came round she treated herself with a little more care, and lay quietly feeling gently nauseous. She poked gingerly at her memory of what had happened. It was dark and blotchy, and came at her in sick, greasy waves like the North Sea. Lumpy things jumbled themselves out of it, and slowly arranged themselves into a heaving airport. The airport was sour and ached in her head, and in the middle of it, pulsing like a migraine, was the memory of a moment's whirling splurge of light. It became suddenly very clear to her that the check-in concourse of Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport had been hit by a meteorite. Silhouetted in the flare was the fur-coated figure of a big man who must have caught the full force of it, and been reduced instantly to a cloud of atoms that were free to go as they pleased. The thought caused a deep and horrid shudder to go through her. He had been infuriating and arrogant, but she had liked him in an odd way. There had been something oddly noble in his perverse bloody-mindedness—or maybe, she realised, she liked to think that such perverse bloody-mindedness was noble, because it reminded her of herself trying to order pizza to be delivered in an alien, hostile, and non-pizza-delivering world. Nobleness is one word for making a fuss about the trivial inevitabilities of life, but there were others. She felt a sudden surge of fear and loneliness, but it quickly ebbed away, and left her feeling much more composed, relaxed, and wanting to go to the lavatory. According to her watch it was shortly after three o'clock, and according to everything else it was night-time. She should probably call a nurse, and let the world know she had come round. There was a window in the side-wall of the room through which she could see a dim corridor, in which stood a stretcher-trolley and a tall black oxygen-bottle, but which was otherwise empty. Things were very quiet out there. Peering round her in the small room, she saw a white-painted plywood cupboard, a couple of tubular steel and vinyl chairs lurking quietly in the shadows, and a white-painted plywood bedside cabinet, which supported a small bowl with a single banana in it. On the other side of the bed stood her drip-stand. Set into the wall on that side of the bed was a metal plate with a couple of black knobs and a set of old bake-light headphones hanging from it, and wound round the tubular side pillar of the bed-head was a cable with a bell-push attached to it, which she fingered, and then decided not to push. She was fine. She could find her own way about. Slowly, a little woosily, she pushed herself up onto her elbows, and slid her legs out from under the sheets and onto the floor, which was cold to her feet. She could tell almost immediately that she shouldn't be doing this, because every part of her feet was sending back streams of messages telling her exactly what every tiniest bit of the floor that they touched felt like, as if it was a strange and worrying thing the like of which they had never encountered before. Nevertheless, she sat on the edge of the bed, and made her feet accept the floor as something they were just going to have to get used to. The hospital had put her into a large baggy, striped thing. It wasn't merely baggy, she decided, on examining it more closely. It actually was a bag—a bag of loose blue and white-striped cotton. It opened up the back and let in chilly night draughts. Perfunctory sleeves flopped half-way down her arms. She moved her arms around in the light, examining the skin, rubbing it, and pinching it, especially around the bandage which held her drip-needle in place. Normally her arms were lithe, and the skin was firm and supple. To-night, however, they looked like bits of chickens. Briefly she smoothed each forearm with her other hand, and then looked up again, purposefully. She reached out and gripped the drip-stand, and, because it wobbled slightly less than she did, she was able to use it to pull herself slowly to her feet. She stood there, her tall, slim figure trembling, and after a few seconds she held the drip-stand away at a bent arm's length, like a shepherd holding a crook. She had not made it to Norway, but she was at least standing up. The drip-stand rolled on four small and independently perverse wheels, which behaved like four screaming children in the supermarket, but nevertheless Kate was able to propel it to the door ahead of her. Walking increased her sense of wooziness, but also increased her resolve not to give in to it. She reached the door, opened it, and pushing the drip-stand out ahead of her, looked out into the corridor. To her left the corridor ended in a couple of swing doors with circular porthole windows, which seemed to lead into a larger area, an open ward, perhaps. To her right a number of smaller doors opened off the corridor as it continued on for a short distance before turning a sharp corner. One of those doors would probably be the lavatory. The others? Well, she would find out as she looked for the lavatory. The first two were cupboards. The third was slightly bigger and had a chair in it, and therefore probably counted as a room, since most people don't like to sit in cupboards—even nurses, who have to do a lot of things that most people wouldn't like to. It also had a stack of Styro-beakers, a lot of semi-congealed coffee-creamer, and an elderly coffee-maker, all sitting on top of a small table together and seeping grimly over a copy of the evening standard. Kate picked up the dark, damp paper and tried to reconstruct some of her missing days from it. However, what with her own wobbly condition making it difficult to read, and the droopily stuck-together condition of the newspaper, she was able to glean little more than the fact that no one could really say for certain what had happened. It seemed that no one had been seriously hurt, but that an employee of one of the airlines was still unaccounted for. The incident had now been officially classified as an act of God. Nice one, God, thought Kate. She put down the remains of the paper and closed the door behind her. The next door she tried was another small side-ward like her own. There was a bedside table and a single banana in the fruit-bowl. The bed was clearly occupied. She pulled the door to quickly, but she did not pull it quickly enough. Unfortunately, something odd had caught her attention, but although she had noticed it she could not immediately say what it was. She stood there with the door half-closed, staring at the floor, knowing that she should not look again and knowing that she would. Carefully she eased the door-bag open again. The room was darkly shadowed and chilly. The chilliness did not give her a good feeling about the occupant of the bed. She listened. The silence didn't sound too good either. It wasn't the silence of healthy, deep sleep. It was the silence of nothing but a little distant traffic noise. She hesitated for a long while, silhouetted in the doorway, looking and listening. She wondered about the sheer bulk of the occupant of the bed, and how cold he was with just a thin blanket pulled over him. Next to the bed was a small, tubular-legged vinyl bucket-chair, which was rather overwhelmed by the huge and heavy fur-coat draped over it, and Kate thought that the coat should more properly be draped over the bed and its cold occupant. At last, walking as softly and cautiously as she could, she moved into the room and over to the bed. She stood looking down at the face of the big, Nordic man. Though cold and though his eyes were shut, his face was frowning slightly, as if he were still rather worried about something. This struck Kate as being almost infinitely sad. In life the man had had the air of someone who was beset by huge, if somewhat puzzling, difficulties, and the appearance that he had almost immediately found things beyond this life that were a bother to him as well was miserable to contemplate. She was astonished that he appeared to be so unscathed. His skin was totally unmarked. It was rugged and healthy, or rather had been healthy until very recently. Closer inspection showed a network of fine lines which suggested that he was older than the mid-thirties she had originally assumed. He could even have been a very fit and healthy man in his late forties. Standing against the wall by the door was something unexpected. It was a large Coca-Cola vending machine. It didn't look as if it had been installed there, it wasn't plugged in, and it had a small neat sticker on it explaining that it was temporarily out of order. It looked as if it had simply been left there inadvertently by someone who was probably even now walking around wondering which room he had left it in. Its large red-and-white wavy panel stared glassily into the room and did not explain itself. The only thing the machine communicated to the outside world was that there was a slot into which coins of a variety of denominations might be inserted, and an aperture to which a variety of different cans would be delivered if the machine was working, which it was not. There was also an old sledgehammer leaning against it, which was in its own way odd. Faintness began to creep over Kate. The room began to develop a slight spin, and there was some restless rustling in the cabin trunks of her mind. Then she realized that the rustling wasn't simply her imagination. There was a distinct noise in the room, a heavy, beating, scratching noise, a muffled fluttering. The noise rose and fell like the wind, but in her dazed and woozy state Kate could not at first tell where the noise was coming from. At last her gaze fell on the curtains. She stared at them with the worried frown of a drunk trying to work out why the door is dancing. The sound was coming from the curtains. She walked uncertainly towards them and pulled them apart. A huge eagle with circles tattooed on its wings was clattering and beating against the window, staring in with great yellow eyes and pecking wildly at the glass. Kate staggered back, turned, and tried to heave herself out of the room. At the end of the corridor the porthole doors swung open and two figures came through them. Hands rushed towards her as she became hopelessly entangled in the drip-stand, and began slowly to spin towards the floor. She was unconscious as they carefully laid her back in her bed. She was unconscious half an hour later, when a disturbingly short figure in a worryingly long white doctor's coat arrived, wheeled the big man away on a stretcher trolley, and then returned after a few minutes for the Coca-Cola machine. She woke a few hours later with the wintry sun seeping through the window. The day looked very quiet and ordinary, but Kate was still shaking.
 Chapter 20 Leaping on to the back of a one-and-a-half-ton perfectly normal beast, migrating through your world at a thundering twenty miles an hour, is not as easy as it might at first seem. Certainly it is not as easy as the Lamuel and Hunters had made it seem, and Arthur Dent was prepared to discover that this might turn out to be the difficult bit. What he hadn't been prepared to discover, however, was how difficult it was even getting to the difficult bit. It was the bit that was supposed to be the easy bit, which turned out to be practically impossible. They couldn't even catch the attention of a single animal. The perfectly normal beasts were so intent on working up a good thunder with their hooves, heads down, shoulders forward, back legs pounding the ground into porridge, that it would have taken something not merely startling but actually geological to disturb them. The sheer amount of thundering and pounding was, in the end, more than Arthur and Ford could deal with. After they had spent nearly two hours prancing about doing increasingly foolish things with a medium-sized, floral-patterned bath-towel, they had not managed to get even one of the great beasts thundering and pounding past them to do so much as glance casually in their direction. They were within three feet of the horizontal avalanche of sweating bodies. To have been much closer would have been to risk instant death, chronologic or no-chronologic. Arthur had seen what remained of any perfectly normal beast, which, as the result of a clumsy misthrow by a young and inexperienced Lamuel and Hunter, had got speared while still thundering and pounding with the herd. One stumble was all it took. No prior appointment with death on Stavromula Beta—wherever the hell Stavromula Beta was—would save you or anybody else from the thunderous, mangling pounding of those hooves. At last Arthur and Ford staggered back. They sat down, exhausted and defeated, and started to criticise each other's technique with the towel. "'You've got to flick it more,' complained Ford. "'You need more follow-through from the elbow if you're going to get those blasted creatures to notice anything at all.' "'Follow-through!' protested Arthur. "'You need more suppleness in the wrist. You need more after-flourish,' counted Ford. "'You need a bigger towel.' "'You need,' said another voice, a picker-bird. "'You what?' The voice had come from behind them. They turned, and there, standing behind them in the early morning sun, was old Thrashbarg. "'To attract the attention of a perfectly normal beast,' he said, as he walked forward towards them, "'you need a picker-bird, like this. From under the rough cassocky robe-like thing he wore he drew a small picker-bird. It sat restlessly on old Thrashbarg's hand, and peered intently at Bob knows what, darting around about three feet six inches in front of it. Ford instantly went into the sort of alert crouch he liked to do when he wasn't quite sure what was going on or what he ought to do about it. He waved his arms around very slowly in what he hoped was an ominous manner. "'Who is this?' he hissed. "'It's just old Thrashbarg,' said Arthur quietly. "'And I wouldn't bother with all your fancy movements. He's just as experienced a bluffer as you are. You could end up dancing round each other all day.' "'The bird!' hissed Ford again. "'What's the bird?' "'It's just a bird,' said Arthur impatiently. "'It's like any other bird. It lays eggs and goes arc at things you can't see, or car or writ or something.' "'Have you seen one lay eggs?' said Ford suspiciously. "'For Heaven's sake, of course I have,' said Arthur. "'I've eaten hundreds of them. Make rather a good omelette. The secret is little cubes of cold butter, and then whipping it lightly with—' "'I don't want a zarking recipe,' said Ford. "'I just want to be sure it's real. It's a real bird, not some kind of multidimensional cyber-nightmare.' He slowly stood up from his crouched position and started to brush himself down. He was still watching the bird, though. "'So,' said old Thrashbarg to Arthur, "'it is written that Bob shall once more take back unto himself the benediction of his once-given sandwich-maker.' Ford almost went back into his crouch. "'It's all right,' muttered Arthur. He always talks like that. "'Allowed,' he said. "'Ah! Venerable Thrashbarg, um, yes, I'm afraid I think I'm going to have to be popping off now. But young Drimple, my apprentice, will be a fine sandwich-maker in my stead. He has the aptitude, a deep love of sandwiches, and the skills he has acquired so far, though rudimentarist yet, will in time mature and—well, I think he'll work out okay, is what I'm trying to say.' Old Thrashbarg regarded him gravely. His old grey eyes moved sadly. He held his arms aloft, one still carrying a bobbing picker-bird, the other his staff. "'Oh, sandwich-maker from Bob!' he pronounced. He paused, furrowed his brow, and sighed as he closed his eyes in pious contemplation. "'Life,' he said, 'will be a very great deal less weird without you.' Arthur was stunned. "'Do you know,' he said, 'I think that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me.' "'Can we get on, please?' said Ford. Something was already happening. The presence of the picker-bird at the end of Thrashbarg's outstretched arm was sending tremors of interest through the thundering herd. The odd head flicked momentarily in their direction. Arthur began to remember some of the perfectly normal beast-hunts he had witnessed. He recalled that as well as the hunter-matadors brandishing their capes, there were always others standing behind them holding picker-birds. He had always assumed that, like him, they had just come along to watch. Old Thrashbarg moved forward a little closer to the rolling herd. Some of the beasts were now tossing their heads back with interest at the sight of the picker-bird. Old Thrashbarg's outstretched arms were trembling. Only the picker-bird itself seemed to show no interest in what was going on. A few anonymous molecules of air, nowhere in particular, engaged all of its perky attention. "'Now!' exclaimed Old Thrashbarg at last. "'Now you may work them with the towel!' Arthur advanced with Ford's towel, moving the way the hunter-matadors did, with a kind of elegant strut that did not come at all naturally to him. But now he knew what to do and that it was right. He brandished and flicked the towel a few times, to be ready for the moment, and then he watched. Some distance away he spotted the beast he wanted. Head down, it was galloping towards him right on the very edge of the herd. Old Thrashbarg twitched the bird. The beast looked up, tossed its head, and then, just as its head was coming down again, Arthur flourished the towel in the beast's line of sight. It tossed its head again in bemusement, and its eyes followed the movement of the towel. He had got the beast's attention. From that moment on it seemed the most natural thing to coax and draw the animal towards him. Its head was up, cocked slightly to one side. It was slowing to a canter, and then a trot. A few seconds later the huge thing was standing there amongst them, snorting, panting, sweating, and sniffing excitedly at the picker-bird, which appeared not to have noticed its arrival at all. With strange sort of sweeping movements of his arms Old Thrashbarg kept the picker-bird in front of the beast, but always out of its reach and always downwards. With strange sort of sweeping movements of the towel Arthur kept drawing the beast's attention this way and that, always downward. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so stupid in my life, muttered Ford to himself. At last the beast dropped, bemused but docile, to its knees. Go! whispered Old Thrashbarg urgently to Ford. Go! Go now! Ford leapt up onto the great creature's back, scrabbling amongst its thick knotty fur for purchase, grasping great hands full of the stuff to hold him steady once he was in position. Now, sandwich-maker, go! He performed some elaborate sign and ritual handshake, which Arthur couldn't quite get the hang of, because Old Thrashbarg had obviously made it up on the spur of the moment. Then he pushed Arthur forward. Taking a deep breath he clambered up behind Ford, onto the great hot heaving back of the beast, and held on tight. Huge muscles the size of sea-lions rippled and flexed beneath him. Old Thrashbarg held the bird suddenly aloft. The beast's head swivelled up to follow it. Thrashbarg pushed upwards and upwards repeatedly with his arms and with the picker-bird, and slowly, heavily, the perfectly normal beast lurched up off its knees and stood at last swaying slightly, its two riders held on fiercely and nervously. Arthur gazed out over the sea of hurtling animals, straining in an attempt to see where it was they were going, but there was nothing but heat haze. "'Can you see anything?' he said to Ford. "'No.' Ford twisted round to glance back, trying to see if there was any clue as to where they had come from. Still nothing. Arthur shouted down at Thrashbarg. "'Do you know where they come from?' he called. "'Or where they're going?' "'The domain of the King!' shouted old Thrashbarg back. "'King!' shouted Arthur in surprise. "'What King?' The perfectly normal beast was swaying and rocking restlessly under him. "'What do you mean, what King?' shouted old Thrashbarg. "'The King!' "'It's just that you never mentioned a King!' shouted Arthur back, in some consonation. "'What?' shouted old Thrashbarg. The thrumming of a thousand hooves was very hard to hear over, and the old man was concentrating on what he was doing. Still holding the bird aloft he led the beast slowly round till it was once more parallel with the motion of its great herd. He moved forward. The beast followed. He moved forward again. The beast followed again. At last the beast was lumbering forward with a little momentum. "'I said you never mentioned a King!' shouted Arthur again. "'I didn't say a King!' shouted old Thrashbarg. "'I said THE King!' He drew back his arm, and then hurled it forward with all his strength, casting the picker-bird up into the air above the herd. This seemed to catch the picker-bird completely by surprise, as it had obviously not been paying any attention at all to what was going on. It took it a moment or two to work out what was happening. Then it unfurled its little wings, spread them out, and flew. "'Go!' shouted Thrashbarg. "'Go and meet your destiny, sandwich-maker!' Arthur wasn't so sure about wanting to meet his destiny as such. He just wanted to get to wherever it was they were going, so he could get back off this creature again. He didn't feel at all safe up there. The beast was gathering speed as it followed in the wake of the picker-bird, and then it was in at the fringes of the great tide of animals. And in a moment or two, with its head down, the picker-bird forgotten, it was running with the herd again, and rapidly approaching the point at which the herd was vanishing into thin air. Arthur and Ford held on to the great monster for dear life, surrounded on all sides by hurtling mountains of bodies. "'Oh, ride that beast!' shouted Thrashbarg. His distant voice reverberated in their ears. "'Ride that perfectly normal beast! Ride it! Ride it!' Ford shouted in Arthur's ear. "'Where did he say we were going?' "'He said something about a king,' shouted Arthur in return, holding on desperately. "'What king?' "'That's what I said. He just said THE king!' "'I didn't know there was a THE king!' shouted Ford. "'Nor did I!' shouted Arthur back. "'Except, of course, for THE king!' shouted Ford. "'No, that's what he meant him!' "'What king?' shouted Arthur. The point of exit was almost upon them. Just ahead of them, perfectly normal beasts were galloping into nothingness and vanishing. "'What do you mean, what king?' shouted Ford. "'I don't know what king. I'm only saying that he couldn't possibly mean THE king, so I don't know what he means.' "'Ford, I don't know what you're talking about!' "'So?' said Ford. Then with a sudden rush the stars came on, turned and twisted round their heads, and then just as suddenly turned off again.
 Chapter 23. The news networks don't like this kind of thing. They regard it as a waste. An incontrovertible spaceship arrives out of nowhere in the middle of London, and it is sensational news of the highest magnitude. Another completely different one arrives three and a half hours later, and somehow it isn't. Another spacecraft, said the headlines and newsstand billboards. This one's pink. A couple of months later they could have made a lot more of it. The third spacecraft, half an hour after that, the little forebirth Hurundi runabout, only made it onto the local news. Ford and Arthur had come screaming down out of the stratosphere and parked neatly on Portland Place. It was just after six-thirty in the evening, and there were spaces free. They mingled briefly with the crowd that had gathered round Ogle, then said loudly that if no one else was going to go and call the police, they would, and may good there escape. Home, said Arthur, a husky tone creeping into his voice as he gazed misty-eyed round him. Oh, don't get all maudlin on me, snapped Ford. We have to find your daughter, and we have to find that bird thing. How, said Arthur. This is a planet of five and a half billion people, and— Yes, said Ford, but only one of them has just arrived from outer space in a large silver spaceship accompanied by a mechanical bird. I suggest we find a television and something to drink while we watch it. We need some serious room service. They checked into a large two-bedroom suite at the Langham. Mysteriously, Ford's dino-charge card, issued on a planet over five thousand light-years away, seemed to present the hotel's computer with no problems. Ford hit the phone straight away while Arthur attempted to locate the television. OK, said Ford, I want to order up some margaritas, please, a couple of pitchers, a couple of chef's salad, and as much foie gras as you've got, and also London Zoo. She's on the news! shouted Arthur from the next room. That's what I said, said Ford, and to the phone London Zoo. Just charge it to the room. She's— Good God! shouted Arthur. Do you know who she's being interviewed by? Are you having difficulty understanding the English language? continued Ford. It's the zoo just up the road from here. I don't care if it's closed this evening. I don't want to buy a ticket. I just want to buy the zoo. I don't care if you're busy. This is room service. I'm in a room, and I want some service. Got a piece of paper? OK, here's what I want you to do. All the animals that can be safely returned to the wild, return them. Set up some good teams of people to monitor their progress in the wild, see that they're doing OK. It's Trillian! shouted Arthur. Or is it? God, I can't stand all this parallel universe stuff. It's so bloody confusing. It seems to be a different Trillian. It's Tricia McMillan, which is what Trillian used to be called before. Why don't you come and watch? See if you can figure it out. Just a second, Ford shouted, and returned to his negotiations with room service. Then we'll need some natural reserves for the animals that can't hack it in the wild, he said. Set up a team to work out the best places to do that. We might need to buy somewhere like Zaire, maybe some islands, Madagascar, Baffin, Sumatra, those kind of places. We'll need a wide variety of habitats. Look, I don't see why you're seeing this as a problem. Learn to delegate. Hire whoever you want. Get on to it. I think you'll find my credit is good. And blue cheese dressing on the salad, thank you. He put the phone down and went through to Arthur, who was sitting on the edge of his bed watching television. I ordered us some foie gras, said Ford. What? said Arthur, whose attention was entirely focused on the television. I said I ordered us some foie gras. Oh, said Arthur vaguely. I always feel a bit bad about foie gras. A bit cruel to the geese, isn't it? Ah, fuck them, said Ford, slumping on the bed. You can't care about every damn thing. Well, that's all very well for you to say, but drop it, said Ford. If you don't like it, I'll have yours. What's happening? Chaos, said Arthur, complete chaos. Random keeps on screaming at Trillian or Trisha or whoever it is that she abandoned her, and then demanding to go to a good nightclub. Trisha's broken down in tears and says she's never even met Random, let alone given birth to her. Then she suddenly started howling about someone called Rupert and said that he'd lost his mind or something. I didn't follow that bit, to be honest. Then Random started throwing stuff and they cut to a commercial break while they try and sort it out. Oh, oh, they've just cut back to the studio. Shut up and watch. A rather shaken Anchorman appeared on the screen and apologised to viewers for the disruption of the previous item. He said that he didn't have any very clear news to report, only that the mysterious girl, who called herself Random Frequent Flyer Dent, had left the studio to rest. Trisha McMillan would be, he hoped, back tomorrow. Meanwhile, fresh reports of UFO activity were coming in. Ford leapt off the bed, grabbed the nearest phone and jabbed at a number. Concierge, you want to own the hotel? It's yours if you can find out for me in five minutes which clubs Trisha McMillan belongs to. Just charge the whole thing to this room.
 Cigarettes clearly intended to make themselves a major problem for Dirk to-night. For most of the day, except for when he had woken up, and except for again shortly after he had woken up, and except for when he had just encountered the revolving head of Geoffrey Anstey, which was understandable, and also except for when he had been in the pub with Kate, he had had absolutely no cigarettes at all—not one. They were out of his life, forsworn utterly. He didn't need them. He could do without them. They merely nagged at him like mad, and made his life a living hell. But he decided he could handle that. Now, however, just when he had suddenly decided, coolly, rationally, as a clear, straightforward decision, rather than merely a feeble surrender to craving, that he would, after all, have a cigarette, could he find one? He could not. The pubs by this stage of the night were well closed. The late-night corner shop obviously meant something different by late night than Dirk did. And though Dirk was certain that he could convince the proprietor of the rightness of his case through sheer linguistic and syllogistic bravado, the wretched man wasn't there to undergo it. A mile away there was a twenty-four-hour filling station, but it turned out just to have sustained an armed robbery. The plate-glass was shattered and crazed around a tiny hole. Police were swarming over the place. The attendant was apparently not badly injured, but was still losing blood from a wound in his arm, having hysterics, and being treated for shock, and no one would sell Dirk any cigarettes. They simply weren't in the mood. You could buy cigarettes in the blitz, protested Dirk. People took a pride in it. Even with the bombs falling and the whole city ablaze, you could still get served. Some poor fellow just lost two daughters and a leg would still say plain or filter-tip if you asked him. I expect you would, too, muttered a white-faced young policeman. He was the spirit of the age, said Dirk. Bug off, said the policeman. And that, thought Dirk to himself, was the spirit of this. He retreated, miffed, and decided to prowl the streets with his hands in his pockets for a while. Camden Passage. Antique clocks. Antique clothes. No cigarettes. Upper Street. Antique buildings being ripped apart. No sign of cigarette shops being put in their place. Chapel Market, desolate at night. Wet litter wildly flapping. Cardboard boxes, egg boxes, paper bags and cigarette packets. Empty ones. Pentonville Road. Grim concrete monoliths, eyeing the new spaces in Upper Street where they hoped to spawn their horrid progeny. Kings Cross Station. They must have cigarettes, for heaven's sake. Dirk hurried on down towards it. The old frontage to the station reared up above the area, a great yellow brick wall, with a clock-tower and two huge arches fronting the two great train-sheds behind. In front of this lay the one-storey modern concourse, which was already far shabbier than the building a hundred years its senior, which it obscured and generally messed up. Dirk imagined that when the designs from the modern concourse had been drawn up, the architects had explained that it entered into an exciting and challenging dialogue with the older building. Kings Cross is an area where terrible things happen to people, to buildings, to cars, to trains, usually while you wait, and if you weren't careful you could easily end up involved in a piece of exciting and challenging dialogue yourself. You could have a cheap car radio fitted while you waited, and if you turned your back for a couple of minutes it would be removed while you waited as well. Other things you could have removed while you waited were your wallet, your stomach-lining, your mind, and your will to live. The muggers and pushers and pimps and hamburger salesmen, in no particular order, could arrange all these things for you. But could they arrange a packet of cigarettes? thought Dirk, with a mounting sense of tension. He crossed York Way, declined a couple of surprising offers on the grounds that they did not involve cigarettes in any immediately obvious way, hurried past the closed book-shop and in through the main concourse doors, away from the life of the street, and into the safer domain of British Rail. He looked around him. Here things seemed rather strange, and he wondered why. But he only wondered this very briefly because he was also wondering if there was anywhere open selling cigarettes, and there wasn't. He sagged forlornly. It seemed to him that he had been playing catch-up with the world all day. The morning had started in about as disastrous a way as it was possible for a morning to start, and he had never managed to get a proper grip on it since. He felt like someone trying to ride a bolting horse with one foot in the stirrup and the other one still bounding along hopefully on the ground behind. And now even as simple a thing as a cigarette was proving to be beyond his ability to get hold of. He sighed and found himself a seat, or at least room, on a bench. This was not an immediately easy thing to do. The station was more crowded than he had expected to find it at—what was it? He looked up at the clock—one o'clock in the morning. What in the name of God was he doing on King's Cross Station at one o'clock in the morning, with no cigarette and no home that he could reasonably expect to get into without being hacked to death by a homicidal bird? He decided to feel sorry for himself. That would pass the time. He looked around himself, and after a while the impulse to feel sorry for himself gradually subsided as he began to take in his surroundings. What was strange about it was seeing such an immediately familiar place looking so unfamiliar. There was the ticket office, still open for ticket sales, but looking sombre and beleaguered, and wishing it was closed. There was the W. H. Smith, closed for the night. No one would be needing any further newspapers or magazines tonight, except for purposes of accommodation, and old ones would do just as well for sleeping under. The pimps and hookers, drug-pushers and hamburger salesmen, were all outside in the streets and in the hamburger bars. If you wanted quick sex or a dirty fix or, God help you, a hamburger, that was where you went to get it. Here were the people that nobody wanted anything from at all. This was where they gathered for shelter, until they were periodically shooed out. There was something people wanted from them, in fact. Their absence. That was in hot demand, but not easily supplied. Everybody has to be somewhere. Dirk looked round from one to another of the men and women shuffling around or sitting hunched in seats or struggling to try and sleep across benches that were specifically designed to prevent them from doing exactly that. Got a fag, mate? What? No, I'm sorry, no, I haven't got one, replied Dirk, awkwardly patting his coat-pockets in embarrassment, as if to suggest the making of a search which he knew would be fruitless. He was startled to be summoned out of his reverie like this. Here you are, then. The old man offered him a beat-up one from a beat-up packet. What? Oh, oh, thanks. Thank you. Momentarily taken aback by the offer, Dirk nevertheless accepted the cigarette gratefully. And took a light from the tip of the cigarette the old man was smoking himself. What you come here for, then? asked the old man. Not challenging, just curious. Dirk tried to look at him without making it seem as if he was looking him up and down. The man was wildly bereft of teeth, had startled and matted hair, and his old clothes were well mulched down around him. But the eyes which sagged out of his face were fairly calm. He wasn't expecting anything worse than he could deal with to happen to him. Well, just this, in fact, said Dirk, twiddling the cigarette. Thanks. Couldn't find one anywhere. Oh, ah, said the old man. Got this mad bird at home, said Dirk, kept attacking me. Oh, ah, said the man, nodding resignedly. I mean an actual bird, said Dirk, an eagle. Oh, ah, with great wings. Oh, ah, got hold of me with one of its talons through the letterbox. Oh, ah, Dirk wondered if it was worth pursuing the conversation much further. He lapsed into silence and looked around. You're lucky it didn't slash at you with its beak as well, said the old man after a while. An eagle will do that when roused. It did, said Dirk. It did. Look, right here on my nose. That was through the letterbox as well. You'd scarcely believe it. Talk about grip, talk about reach. Look what it did to my hand. He held it out for sympathy. The old man gave it an appraising look. Oh, ah, he said at last, and retreated into his own thoughts. Dirk drew his injured hand back. Know a lot about eagles, then, do you? The man didn't answer, but seemed instead to retreat still further. Lot of people here to-night, Dirk ventured again after a while. The man shrugged. He took a long drag on his cigarette, half closing his eyes against the smoke. Is it always like this? I mean, are there always so many people here at night? The man merely looked down, slowly releasing the smoke from his mouth and nostrils. Yet again Dirk looked around. A man a few feet away, not so old-looking as Dirk's companion, but wildly deranged in his demeanour, had sat nodding hectically over a bottle of cooking-brandy all this time. He slowly stopped his nodding, screwed with difficulty a cap onto the bottle, and slipped it into the pocket of his ragged old coat. An old fat woman, who had been fitfully browsing through the bulging black bin-liner of her possessions, began to twist the top of it together, and fold it. You'd almost think that something was about to happen, said Dirk. Oah! said his companion. He put his hands on his knees, bent forward, and raised himself painfully to his feet. Though he was bent and slow, and though his clothes were dirt-ridden and tattered, there was some little power and authority there in his bearing. The air, which he unsettled as he stood, which flowed out from the folds of his skin and clothes, was richly pungent even to Dirk's numbed nostrils. It was a smell that never stopped coming at him. Just as Dirk thought it must have peaked, so it struck on upwards with renewed frenzy, till Dirk thought that his very brain would vaporise. He tried not to choke. Indeed, he tried to smile courteously, without allowing his eyes to run, as the man turned to him and said, Infuse some blossom of the bitter orange. Add some sprinklings of sage while it is still warm. This is very good for eagle wounds. There are those who will add apricot and almond oil, and even the Heaven's Defender's cedra. But then there are always those that will overdo things, and sometimes we have need of them. Oh, ah! With that he turned away once more, and joined the growing stream of pathetic, hunched, and abused bodies that were heading for the front exit from the station. In all about two, maybe three dozen were leaving. Each seemed to be leaving separately, each for his or her entirely independent reasons, and not following too fast the one upon the other. And yet it was not hard to tell, for anyone who cared to watch these people, that no one cared to watch or see, that they were leaving together and in a stream. Dirk carefully nursed his cigarette for a moment or so, and watched them intently as one by one they left. Once he was certain that there were no more to go, and that the last two or three of them were at the door, he dropped the cigarette and grounded out with his heel. Then he noticed that the old man had left behind his crumpled cigarette packet. Dirk looked inside, and saw that there were still two bedraggled cigarettes left. He pocketed it, stood up, and quietly followed it a distance that he thought was properly respectful. Outside, on the Euston Road, the night air was grumbling and unsettled. He loitered idly by the doorway, watching which way they went—to the west. He took one of the cigarettes out and lit it, and then idled off westwards himself, around the taxi-rank, and towards St. Pancras Street. On the west side of St. Pancras Street, just a few yards north of the Euston Road, a flight of steps leads up to the forecourt of the old Midland Grand Hotel—the huge, dark, Gothic fantasy of a building, which stands empty and desolate across the front of St. Pancras Railway Station. Over the top of the steps, picked out in gold letters on wrought iron work, stands the name of the station. Taking his time, Dirk followed the last of the band of old tramps and derelicts up these steps, which emerged just to the side of a small squat brick building, which was used as a car-park. To the right, the great dark hulk of the old hotel spread off into the night, its roof-line a vast assortment of wild turrets, gnarled spires and pinnacles, which seemed to prod at and goad the night sky. High in the dim darkness, silent stone figures stood guard behind long shields, grouped around pilasters behind wrought iron railings. Carved dragons crouched gaping at the sky, as Dirk gently, in his flapping leather coat, approached the great iron portals which led to the hotel and to the great vaulted train-shed of St. Pancras Station. Stone figures of winged dogs crouched down from the tops of pillars. Here, in the bridged area between the hotel entrance and the station booking-hall, was parked a large, unmarked, grey Mercedes van. A quick glance at the front of it was enough to tell Dirk that it was the same one that had nearly forced him off the road several hours earlier in the Cotswolds. Dirk walked into the booking-hall, a large space with great panelled walls, along which were spaced fat marble columns in the form of torch-holders. At this time of night the ticket-office was closed. Trains do not run all night from St. Pancras, and beyond it the vast chamber of the station itself, the great Victorian train-shed, was shrouded in darkness and shadow. Dirk stood quietly secluded in the entrance to the booking-hall, and watched as the old tramps and bag-ladies, who had entered the station by the main entrance from the forecourt, mingled together in the dimness. There were now many more than two dozen of them, perhaps as many as a hundred, and there seemed to be about them an air of repressed excitement and tension. As they moved about, it seemed to Dirk, after a while, that though he had been surprised at how many of them there had been when he first arrived, there seemed now to be fewer and fewer of them. He peered into the gloom trying to make out what was happening. He detached himself from his seclusion in the entrance to the booking-hall, and entered the main vault, but kept himself nevertheless as close to the side-wall as possible as he ventured in towards them. There were definitely fewer still of them now—a mere handful left. He had a distinct sense of people slipping away into the shadows and not re-emerging from them. He frowned at them. The shadows were deep, but they weren't that deep. He began to hurry forward, and quickly threw all caution aside to reach the small remaining group, but by the time he reached the centre of the concourse where they had been gathered, there were none remaining at all, and he was left whirling round in confusion in the middle of the great, dark, empty railway station.
 Chapter 8. Ford had his own code of ethics. It wasn't much of one, but it was his, and he stuck by it, more or less. One rule he made was never to buy his own drinks. He wasn't sure if that counted as an ethic, but you have to go with what you've got. He was also firmly and utterly opposed to all and any forms of cruelty to any animals whatsoever except geese, and furthermore he would never steal from his employers. Well, not exactly steal. If his account supervisor didn't start to hyperventilate and put out a seal or exit security alert when Ford handed in his expenses claim, then Ford felt he wasn't doing his job properly. But actually stealing was another thing. That was biting the hand that feeds you. Sucking very hard on it, even nibbling it in an affectionate kind of a way was OK, but you didn't actually bite it, not when that hand was the guide. The guide was something sacred and special. But that, thought Ford as he ducked and weaved his way down through the building, was about to change. And they had only themselves to blame. Look at all this stuff. Lines of neat grey office cubicles and executive workstation pods. The whole place was dreary with the hum of memos and minutes of meetings flitting through its electronic networks. Out in the street they were playing Hunt the Wocket for Zark's sake, but here in the very heart of the guide offices no one was even recklessly kicking a ball around the corridors or wearing inappropriately coloured beachwear. In finidim enterprises, Ford snarled to himself as he stalked rapidly down one corridor after another. Door after door magically opened to him without question. Elevators took him happily to places they should not. Ford was trying to pursue the most tangled and complicated route he could, heading generally downwards through the building. His happy little robot took care of everything, spreading waves of acquiescent joy through all the security circuits it encountered. Ford thought it needed a name, and decided to call it Emily Saunders, after a girl he had very fond memories of. Then he thought that Emily Saunders was an absurd name for a security robot, and decided to call it Colin instead, after Emily's dog. He was moving deep into the bowels of the building now, into areas he had never entered before—areas of higher and higher security. He was beginning to encounter puzzled looks from the operatives he passed. At this level of security you didn't even call them people anymore, and they were probably doing stuff that only operatives would do. When they went home to their families in the evening they became people again, and when their little children looked up at them with their sweet shining eyes and said, "'Daddy, what did you do all day today?' they just said, "'I performed my duties as an operative,' and left it at that." The truth of the matter was that all sorts of highly dodgy stuff went on behind the cheery, happy-go-lucky front that the guy had liked to put up, or used to like to put up, before this new Infinidium Enterprises bunch marched in and started to make the whole thing highly dodgy. There were all kinds of tax scams and rackets and graft and shady deals supporting the shining edifice, and down in the secure research and data processing levels of the building was where it all went on. Every few years the Guide would set up its business, and indeed its building, on a new world, and all would be sunshine and laughter for a while as the Guide would put down its roots in the local culture and economy, provide employment, a sense of glamour and adventure, and in the end not quite as much actual revenue as the locals had expected. When the Guide moved on, taking its building with it, it left a little like a thief in the night—exactly like a thief in the night, in fact. It usually left in the very early hours of the morning, and the following day there always turned out to be a very great deal of stuff missing. Whole cultures and economies would collapse in its wake, often within a week, leaving once thriving planets desolate and shell-shocked, but still somehow feeling that they had been part of some great adventure. The operatives, who shot puzzled glances at Ford as he marched on into the depths of the building's most sensitive areas, were reassured by the presence of Colin, who was flying along with him in a buzz of emotional fulfilment and easing his path for him at every stage. Alarms were starting to go off in other parts of the building. Perhaps that meant that Van Haal had already been discovered, which might be a problem. Ford had been hoping he would be able to slip the identies back into his pocket before he came round. Well, that was a problem for later, and he didn't, for the moment, have the faintest idea how he was going to solve it. For the moment he wasn't going to worry. Wherever he went with little Colin he was surrounded by a cocoon of sweetness and light, and, most importantly, willing and acquiescent elevators and positively obsequious doors. Ford even began to whistle, which was probably his mistake. Nobody liked to whistle, and particularly not the divinity that shapes our ends. The next door wouldn't open. And that was a pity, because it was the very one that Ford had been making for. It stood there before him, grey and resolutely closed, with a sign on it saying, No Admittance. Not even to authorised personnel. You are wasting your time here. Go away. Colin reported that the doors had been getting generally a lot grimmer down here in these lower reaches of the building. They were about ten storeys below ground level now. The air was refrigerated, and the tasteful grey hessian wall weave had given way to brutal grey bolted steel walls. Colin's rampant euphoria had subsided into a kind of determined cheeriness. He said that he was beginning to tire a little. It was taking all his energy to pump the slightest bony me whatsoever into the doors down here. Ford kicked at the door. It opened. A mixture of pleasure and pain, he muttered, always does the trick. He walked in, and Colin flew in after him. Even with the wire stuck straight into his pleasure electrode, his happiness was a nervous kind of happiness. He bobbed around a little. The room was small, grey, and humming. This was the nerve centre of the entire guide. The computer terminals that lined the grey walls were windows on to every aspect of the guide's operations. Here, on the left-hand side of the room, reports were gathered over the sub-ethernet from field researchers in every corner of the galaxy. They'd straight up into the network of sub-editors' offices, where they had all the good bits cut out by secretaries because the sub-editors were out having lunch. The remaining copy would then be shot across to the other half of the building, the other leg of the H, which was the legal department. The legal department would cut out anything that was still even remotely good from what remained, and fire it back to the offices of the executive editors, who were also out to lunch. So the editor's secretaries would read it and say it was stupid and cut out most of what was left. When any of the editors finally staggered in from lunch, they'd exclaim, what is this feeble crap that X—where X was the name of the field researcher in question—has sent us from halfway across the bloody galaxy? What's the point of having somebody spending three whole orbital periods out in the bloody Gagrekaka mine zones, with all that stuff going on out there, if this load of anemic squitter is the best thing we've bothered to send us? Disallow his expenses. "'What shall we do with the copy?' the secretary would ask. "'Ah, put it out over the network. Gotta have something going out there. I've got a headache and going home.' So the edited copy would go for one last slash and burn through the legal department, and then be sent back down here, where it would be broadcast out over the sub-ethernet for instantaneous retrieval anywhere in the galaxy. That was handled by equipment which was monitored and controlled by the terminals on the right-hand side of the room. Meanwhile, the order to disallow the researchers' expenses was relayed down to the computer terminal stuck off in the upper right-hand corner, and it was to this terminal that Ford Prefect now swiftly made his way. If you are reading this on planet Earth, then a. Good luck to you. There is an awful lot of stuff you don't know anything about, but you are not alone in this. It's just that in your case the consequences of not knowing any of this stuff are particularly terrible, but then, hey, that's just the way the cookie gets completely stomped on and obliterated. b. Don't imagine you know what a computer terminal is. A computer terminal is not some clunky old television with a typewriter in front of it. It is an interface where the mind and body can connect with the universe and move bits of it about. Ford hurried over to the terminal, sat in front of it, and quickly dipped himself into its universe. It wasn't the normal universe he knew. It was a universe of densely enfolded worlds, of wild topographies, towering mountain peaks, heart-stopping ravines, of moons shattering off into seahorses, hurtful blurting crevices, silently heaving oceans, and bottomless hurtling hooping fountains. He held still to get his bearings. He controlled his breathing, closed his eyes, and looked again. So this was where accountants spent their time. There was clearly more to them than met the eye. He looked around carefully, trying not to let it all swell and swim and overwhelm him. He didn't know his way around this universe. He didn't even know the physical laws that determined its dimensional extents or behaviours. But his instinct told him to look for the most outstanding feature he could detect and make towards it. Way off in some indistinguishable distance—was it a mile or a million or a mote in his eye?—was a stunning peak that overarched the sky, climbed and climbed, and spread out in flowering agrets, agglomerates, and archimandrites. He welted towards it, hooling and thurling, and at last reached it in the meaninglessly long umphing of time. He clung to it, arms outspread, gripping tightly on to its roughly gnarled and pitted surface. Once he was certain that he was secure, he made the hideous mistake of looking down. While he had been weltering, hooling, and thurling, the distance beneath him had not bothered him unduly. But now that he was gripping, the distance made his heart wilt and his brain bend. His fingers were white with pain and his teeth were grinding and twisting against each other beyond his control. His eyes turned inwards with waves from the willowing extremities of nausea. With an immense effort of will and faith, he simply let go and pushed. He felt himself float away, and then, counterintuitively, upwards and upwards. He threw his shoulders back, let his arms drop, gazed upwards, and let himself be drawn loosely higher and higher. Before long, insofar as such terms had any meaning in this virtual universe, a ledge loomed up ahead of him, on which he could grip and on to which he could clamber. He rose, he gripped, he clambered. He panted a little. This was all a little stressful. He held tightly on to the ledge as he sat. He wasn't sure if this was to prevent himself falling down off it or rising up from it, but he needed something to grip on to as he surveyed the world in which he found himself. The whirling, turning height spanned him and twisted his brain in upon itself till he found himself, eyes closed, whimpering and hugging the hideous wall of towering rock. He slowly brought his breathing back under control again. He told himself repeatedly that he was just in a graphic representation of a world, a virtual universe, a simulated reality. He could snap back out of it at any moment. He snapped back out of it. He was sitting in a blue leatherette, foam-filled, swivel-seated office chair in front of a computer terminal. He relaxed. He was clinging to the face of an impossibly high peak, perched on a narrow ledge above a drop of brain-swivelling dimensions. It wasn't just the landscape being so far beneath him. He wished it would stop undulating and waving. He had to get a grip, not on the rock wall—that was an illusion. He had to get a grip on the situation, be able to look at the physical world he was in while drawing himself out of it emotionally. He clenched inwardly and then, just as he had let go of the rock face itself, he let go of the idea of the rock face and let himself just sit there clearly and freely. He looked out at the world. He was breathing well. He was cool. He was in charge again. He was in a four-dimensional topological model of the Guide's financial systems, and somebody or something would very shortly want to know why. And here they came. Swooping through virtual space towards him came a small flock of mean and steely-eyed creatures with pointy little heads, pencil moustaches, and querulous demands as to who he was, what he was doing there, what his authorisation was, what the authorisation of his authorising agent was, what his inside leg measurement was, and so on. Laser-light flickered all over him, as if he was a packet of biscuits at a supermarket check-out. The heavy-duty laser-guns were held for the moment in reserve. The fact that all of this was happening in virtual space made no difference. Being virtually killed by a virtual laser in virtual space is just as effective as the real thing, because you are as dead as you think you are. The laser-readers were becoming very agitated as they flicked over his fingerprints, his retina, and the follicle pattern where his hairline was receding. They didn't like what they were finding at all. The chattering and screeching of highly personal and incident questions was rising in pitch. A little surgical steel-scraper was reaching out towards the skin at the nape of his neck, when Ford, holding his breath and praying very slightly, pulled Van Hal's identies out of his pocket and waved it in front of them. Instantly every laser was diverted to the little card, and swept backwards and forwards over it and in it, examining and reading every molecule. Then, just as suddenly, they stopped. The entire flock of little virtual inspectors snapped to attention. "'Nice to see you, Mr. Hal,' they said in smarmy unison. "'Is there anything we can do for you?' Ford smiled a slow and vicious smile. "'Do you know,' he said, "'I rather think there is.'" Five minutes later he was out of there, about thirty seconds to do the job, and three minutes thirty to cover his tracks. He could have done anything he liked in the virtual structure, more or less. He could have transferred the ownership of the entire organisation into his own name, but he doubted if that would have gone unnoticed. He didn't want it, anyway. It would have meant responsibility, working late nights at the office, not to mention massive and time-consuming fraud investigations and a fair amount of time in jail. He wanted something that nobody other than the computer would notice. That was the bit that took thirty seconds. The thing that took three minutes thirty was programming the computer not to notice that it had noticed anything. It had to want not to know about what Ford was up to. Then he could safely lead the computer to rationalise its own defences against the information ever emerging. It was a programming technique that had been reverse-engineered from the sort of psychotic mental blocks that otherwise perfectly normal people had been observed invariably to develop when elected to high political office. The other minute was spent discovering that the computer system already had a mental block, a big one. He would never have discovered it if he hadn't been busy engineering a mental block himself. He came across a whole slew of smooth and plausible denial procedures and diversionary subroutines exactly where he had been planning to install his own. The computer denied all knowledge of them, of course, then blankly refused to accept that there was anything even to deny knowledge of, and was generally so convincing that even Ford almost found himself thinking that he must have made a mistake. He was impressed. He was so impressed, in fact, that he didn't bother to install his own mental block procedures. He just set up calls to the ones that were already there, which then called themselves when questioned, so on. He quickly set about debugging the little bits of code he had installed himself, only to discover that they weren't there. Cursing, he searched all over for them, but could find no trace of them at all. He was just about to start installing them all over again when he realized that the reason he couldn't find them was that they were working already. He grinned with satisfaction. He tried to discover what the computer's other mental block was all about, but it seemed, not unnaturally, to have a mental block about it. He could no longer find any trace of it at all, in fact. It was that good. He wondered if he had been imagining it. He wondered if he had been imagining that it was something to do with something in the building, and something to do with the number 13. He ran a few tests. Yes, he had obviously been imagining it. No time for fancy routes now. There was obviously a major security alert in progress. Ford took the elevator up to the ground floor to change to the express elevators. He had somehow to get the Identi-E's back into Harl's pocket before it was missed. How, he didn't know. The doors of the elevator slid open to reveal a large posse of security guards and robots, poised waiting for it, and brandishing filthy-looking weapons. They ordered him out. With a shrug he stepped forward. They all pushed rudely past him into the elevator, which took them down to continue their search for him on the lower levels. Oh, this is fun, thought Ford, giving Colin a friendly pat. Colin was about the first genuinely useful robot Ford had ever encountered. Colin bobbed along in the air in front of him in a lather of cheerful ecstasy. Ford was glad he had named him after a dog. He was highly tempted just to leave at that point and hope for the best, but he knew that the best had a far greater chance of actually occurring if Harl did not discover that his Identi-E's was missing. He had somehow, surreptitiously, to return it. They went to the express elevators. Hi, said the elevator they got into. Hi, said Ford. Where can I take you folks today? said the elevator. Floor 23, said Ford. Ah, seems to be a popular floor today, said the elevator. Hmm, thought Ford, not liking the sound of that at all. The elevator lit up the twenty-third floor on its floor display and started to zoom upwards. Something about the floor display tweaked at Ford's mind, but he couldn't catch what it was and forgot about it. He was more worried about the idea of the floor he was going to being a popular one. He hadn't really thought through how he was going to deal with whatever it was that was happening up there, because he had no idea what he was going to find. He would just have to busk it. They were there. The doors slid open. Ominous quiet. Empty corridor. There was the door to Harl's office, with a slight layer of dust around it. Ford knew that this dust consisted of billions of tiny molecular robots that had crawled out of the woodwork, built each other, rebuilt the door, disassembled each other, and then crept back into the woodwork again and just waited for damage. Ford wondered what kind of life that was, but not for long, because he was a lot more concerned about what his own life was like at that moment. He took a deep breath and started his run.
 Beating a path through the difficult territory to the north-east of Valhalla, a network of paths that seemed to lead only to other paths and then back to the first paths again for another try, went two figures—one a big stupid violent creature with green eyes and a scythe which hung from its belt and often seriously impeded its progress, the other a small crazed creature who clung on to the back of the bigger one, manically urging him on while actually impeding his progress still further. They attained at last a long, low, valley building into which they hurried, shouting for horses. The old stablemaster came forward, recognized them, and having heard already of their disgrace, was at first disinclined to help them on their way. The scythe flashed through the air, and the stablemaster's head started upwards in surprise, while his body took an affronted step backwards, swayed uncertainly, and then for lack of any further instructions to the contrary keeled over backwards in its own time. His head bounded into the hay. His assailants hurriedly lashed up two horses to a cart and clattered away out of the stableyard and along the broader thoroughfare which led upwards to the north. They made rapid progress up the road for a mile, To-Rag urging the horses on frantically with a long and cruel whip. After a few minutes, however, the horses began to slow down and to look about them uneasily. To-Rag lashed them all the harder, but they became more anxious still, then suddenly lost all control and reared in terror, turning over the cart and tipping its occupants out onto the road, from which they instantly sprang up in a rage. To-Rag screamed at the terrified horses, and then, out of the corner of his eye, caught sight of what had so disturbed them. It wasn't so terrifying. It was just a large, white, metal box, upturned on a pile of rubbish by the roadside and rattling itself. The horses were rearing and trying to bolt away from the big, white, rattling thing, but they were impossibly entangled in their traces. They were only working themselves up into a thrashing lather of panic. To-Rag quickly realized that there would be no calming them until the box was dealt with. "'Whatever it is!' he screeched at the green-eyed creature. "'Kill it!' Green-Eye unhooked his scythe from his belt once more, and clambered up the pile of rubbish to where the box was rattling. He kicked it, and it only rattled the more. He got his foot behind it, and with a heavy thrust shoved it away down the heap. The big, white box slithered a foot or so, then turned over and toppled to the ground. It rested there for a moment, and then a door, finally freed, flew open. The horses screamed in fear. To-Rag and his green-eyed thug approached the thing with worried curiosity, then staggered back in horror as a great and powerful new god erupted from its innards.
 Chapter 15 The first month getting to know each other was a little difficult. The second month trying to come to terms with what they got to know about each other in the first month was much easier. The third month, when the box arrived, was very tricky indeed. At the beginning it was a problem even trying to explain what a month was. This had been a pleasantly simple matter for Arthur here on Lamuella. The days were just a little over twenty-five hours long, which basically meant an extra hour in bed every single day, and of course having regularly to reset his watch, which Arthur rather enjoyed doing. He also felt at home with the number of suns and moons which Lamuella had, one of each, as opposed to some of the planets he had fetched up on from time to time which had had ridiculous numbers of them. The planet orbited its single sun every three hundred days, which was a good number because it meant the year didn't drag by. The moon orbited Lamuella just over nine times a year, which meant that a month was a little over thirty days, which was absolutely perfect because it gave you a little more time to get things done in. It was not merely reassuringly like Earth, it was actually rather an improvement. Random on the other hand thought she was trapped in a recurring nightmare. She would have crying fits and think the moon was out to get her. Every night it was there, and then when it went, the sun came out and followed her, over and over again. Trillian had warned Arthur that Random might have some difficulty in adjusting to a more regular lifestyle than she had been used to up till now, but Arthur hadn't been ready for actual howling at the moon. He hadn't been ready for any of this, of course. His daughter? His daughter? He and Trillian had never even—had they? He was absolutely convinced he would have remembered. What about the Zaphod? Not the same species, Arthur, Trillian had answered. When I decided I wanted a child they ran all sorts of genetic tests on me, and could find only one match anywhere. It was only later that it dawned on me. I double-checked, and I was right. They don't usually like to tell you, but I insisted. You mean you went to a DNA bank? Arthur had asked, pop-eyed. Yes, but she wasn't quite as Random as her name suggests, because of course you were the only Homo sapiens donor. I must say, though, it assumes you were quite a frequent flyer. Arthur had stared wide-eyed at the unhappy-looking girl who was slouching awkwardly in the door-frame looking at him. But when? How long? You mean what age is she, Sir Trillian? Yes. The wrong one. What do you mean? I mean, Sir Trillian, that I haven't any idea. What? Well, in my time-line I think it's about ten years since I had her, but she's obviously quite a lot older than that. I spend my life going backwards and forwards in time, you see, with the job. I used to take her with me when I could, but it just wasn't always possible. Then I used to put her into day-care time zones, but you just can't get reliable time-tracking done. You leave them there in the morning, and you've simply no idea how old they'll be in the evening. You complain till you're blue in the face, but it doesn't get you anywhere. I left her at one of the places for a few hours once, and when I came back she'd passed puberty. I've done all I can, Arthur. It's over to you. I've got a war to cover. The ten seconds that passed after Trillian left were about the longest of Arthur Dent's life. Time, we know, is relative. You can travel light-years through the stars and back, and if you do it at the speed of light, then when you return you may have aged mere seconds, while your twin brother or sister will have aged twenty, thirty, forty, or however many years it is, depending on how far you travelled. This will come to you as a profound personal shock, particularly if you didn't know you had a twin brother or sister. The seconds that you have been absent for will not have been sufficient time to prepare you for the shock of new and strangely distended family relationships when you return. Ten seconds' silence was not enough for Arthur to reassemble his whole view of himself and his life in a way that suddenly included an entire new daughter, of whose merest existence he had not had the slightest inkling of a suspicion when he had woken that morning. Deep emotional family ties cannot be constructed in ten seconds, however far and fast you travel away from them, and Arthur could only feel hopeless, bewildered, and numb as he looked at the girl standing in his doorway, staring at his floor. He supposed there was no point in pretending not to be hopeless. He walked over and he hugged her. I don't love you, he said. I'm sorry, I don't even know you yet, but give me a few minutes. An extract from Practical Parenting in a Fractally Demented Universe We live in strange times. We also live in strange places, each in a universe of our own. The people with whom we populate our universes are the shadows of whole other universes intersecting with our own. Being able to glance out into this bewildering complexity of infinite recursion and say things like, Oh, hi Ed, nice tan, how's Carol? involves a great deal of filtering skill for which all conscious entities have eventually to develop a capacity in order to protect themselves from the contemplation of the chaos through which they seethe and tumble. So give your kid a break, okay? What's this? Arthur had almost given up. That is to say he was not going to give up. He was absolutely not going to give up. Not now, not ever. But if he had been the sort of person who was going to give up, this was probably the time he would have done it. Not content with being surly, bad-tempered, wanting to go and play in the Paleozoic era, not seeing why they had to have the gravity on the whole time, and shouting at the sun to stop following her, Random had also used his carving-knife to dig up stones to throw at the picker-birds for looking at her like that. Arthur didn't even know if Lamuella had a Paleozoic era. According to Old Thrashbarg, the planet had been found fully formed in the navel of a giant earwig at 4.31 Vroonday afternoon, and although Arthur, as a seasoned galactic traveller with good O-level passes in physics and geography, had fairly serious doubts about this, it was rather a waste of time trying to argue with Old Thrashbarg, and there had never been much point before. He sighed as he sat nursing the chipped and bent knife. He was going to love her if it killed him, or her, or both. It wasn't easy being a father. He knew that no one had ever said it was going to be easy, but that wasn't the point, because he had never asked about being one in the first place. He was doing his best. Every moment he could rest away from making sandwiches he was spending with her, talking to her, walking with her, sitting on the hill with her, watching the sun go down over the valley in which the village was nestled, trying to find out about her life, trying to explain to her about his. It was a tricky business. The common ground between them, apart from the fact that they had almost identical genes, was about the size of a pebble, or rather it was about the size of a trillion, and of her they had slightly differing views. What's this? He suddenly realised she had been talking to him, and he hadn't noticed, or rather he had not recognised her voice. Instead of the usual tone of voice in which she spoke to him, which was bitter and truculent, she was just asking him a simple question. He looked round in surprise. She was sitting there on a stool in the corner of the hut, in that rather hunched way she had, knees together, feet splayed out, with her dark hair hanging down over her face, as she looked at something she had cradled in her hands. Arthur went over to her a little nervously. Her mood swings were very unpredictable, but so far they had all been between different types of bad ones—outbreaks of bitter recrimination would give way, without warning, to abject self-pity, and then long bouts of sullen despair, which were punctuated with sudden acts of mindless violence against inanimate objects, and demands to go to electric clubs. Not only were there no electric clubs on Lamuella, there were no clubs at all, and in fact no electricity. There was a forge and a bakery, a few carts and a well, but those were the high-water mark of Lamuellan technology, and a fair number of randoms' unquenchable rages were directed against the sheer incomprehensible backwardness of the place. She could pick up the sub-ether TV on a small flexo-panel which had been surgically implanted in her wrist, but that didn't cheer her up at all, because it was full of news of insanely exciting things happening in every other part of the galaxy than here. It would also give her frequent news of her mother, who had dumped her to go off and cover some war which now seemed not to have happened, or at least to have gone all wrong in some way, because of the absence of any proper intelligence-gathering. It also gave her access to lots of great adventure shows, featuring all kinds of fantastically expensive spaceships crashing into each other. The villagers were absolutely hypnotised by all these wonderful magic images flashing over her wrist. They had only ever seen one spaceship crash, and it had been so frightening, violent and shocking, and had caused so much horrible devastation, fire and death, that stupidly they had never realised it was entertainment. Old Thrashbark had been so astonished by it that he had instantly seen Random as an emissary from Bob, but had fairly soon afterwards decided that in fact she had been sent as a test of his faith, if not of his patience. He was also alarmed at the number of spaceship crashes he had to start incorporating into his holy stories, if he was to hold the attention of the villagers, and not have them rushing off to peer at Random's wrist all the time. At the moment she was not peering at her wrist. Her wrist was turned off. Arthur squatted down quietly beside her to see what she was looking at. It was his watch. He had taken it off when he had gone to shower under the local waterfall, and Random had found it and was trying to work it out. "'It's just a watch,' she said. "'It's to tell the time.' "'I know that,' she said. 'But you keep on fiddling with it, and it still doesn't tell the right time, or even anything like it.' She brought up the display on her wrist-panel, which automatically produced a read-out of local time. Her wrist-panel had quietly got on with the business of measuring the local gravity and orbital momentum, and had noticed where the sun was, and tracked its movement in the sky, all within the first few minutes of Random's arrival. It had then quickly picked up clues from its environment as to what the local unit conventions were, and reset itself appropriately. It did this sort of thing continually, which was particularly valuable if you did a lot of travelling in time as well as space. Random frowned at her father's watch, which didn't do any of this. Arthur was very fond of it. It was a better one than he would ever have afforded himself. He had been given it on his twenty-second birthday, by a rich and guilt-ridden godfather, who had forgotten every single birthday he had had up till then, and also his name. It had the day, the date, the phases of the moon. It had to Albert on his twenty-first birthday, and the wrong date engraved on the battered and scratched surface of its back, in letters that were still just about visible. The watch had been through a considerable amount of stuff in the last few years, most of which would fall well outside the warranty. He didn't suppose, of course, that the gravity had especially mentioned that the watch was guaranteed to be accurate only within the very particular gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth, and so long as the day was twenty-four hours long, and the planet didn't explode, and so on. These were such basic assumptions that even the lawyers would have missed them. Luckily his watch was a wind-up one, or at least a self-winder. Nowhere else in the galaxy would he have found batteries of precisely the dimensions and power specifications that were perfectly standard on earth. "'So what are all these numbers?' asked Random. Arthur took it from him. "'These numbers round the edge mark the hours. In the little window on the right it says THU, which means Thursday, and the number is fourteen, which means it's the fourteenth day of the month of May, which is what it says in this window over here. And this sort of crescent-shaped window at the top tells you about the phases of the moon. In other words it tells you how much of the moon is lit up at night by the sun, which depends on the relative positions of the sun and the moon and—well, the earth.' "'The earth?' said Random. "'Yes.' "'And that's where you came from, and where Mum came from?' "'Yes,' said Arthur." Random took the watch back from him and looked at it again, clearly baffled by something. Then she held it up to her ear and listened in puzzlement. "'What's that noise?' "'It's ticking,' said Arthur. "'That's the mechanism that drives the watch. It's called clockwork. It's all kind of interlocking cogs and springs that work to turn the hands round at exactly the right speed to mark the hours and minutes and days and so on.' Random carried on peering at it. "'There's something puzzling you,' said Arthur. "'What is it?' "'Yes,' said Random at last. "'Why is it all in hardware?' Arthur suggested they went for a walk. He felt there were things they should discuss, and for once Random seemed, if not precisely amenable and willing, then at least not growling. From Random's point of view this is also all very weird. It wasn't that she wanted to be difficult as such. It was just that she didn't know how or what else to be. Who was this guy? What was this life she was supposed to lead? What was this world she was supposed to lead it in? And what was this universe that kept coming at her through her eyes and ears? What was it for? What did it want?' She had been born in a spaceship that had been going from somewhere to somewhere else, and when it had got to somewhere else, somewhere else had turned out to be only another somewhere that you had to go to somewhere else again from, and so on. It was her normal expectation that she was supposed to be somewhere else. It was normal for her to feel that she was in the wrong place. Then constant time travel had only compounded this problem, and had led to the feeling that she was not only always in the wrong place, but she was also almost always there at the wrong time. She didn't notice that she felt this, because it was the only way she ever felt. Just as it never seemed odd to her that nearly everywhere she went she needed to wear either weights or anti-gravity suits, and usually special apparatus for breathing as well. The only places you could ever feel right were the worlds you'd designed for yourself to inhabit, virtual realities in the electric clubs. It had never occurred to her that the real universe was something you could actually fit into. And that included this Lamuella place her mother had dumped her in, and it also included this person who had bestowed on her this precious and magical gift of life in return for a seat upgrade. It was just as well he'd turned out to be rather kind and friendly, or there would have been trouble, really. She'd got especially sharp and stone in her pocket she could cause a lot of trouble with. It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else's point of view without the proper training. They sat on the spot that Arthur particularly liked, on the side of a hill overlooking the valley. The sun was going down over the village. The only thing that Arthur wasn't quite so fond of was being able to see a little way into the next valley, where a deep, dark, mangled furrow in the forest marked the spot where his ship had crashed. But maybe that was what kept bringing him back here. There were plenty of spots from which you could survey the lush, rolling countryside of Lamuella, but this was the one he was drawn to, with its nagging, dark spot of fear and pain nestling just on the edge of his vision. He had never been there again since he had been pulled out of the wreckage. Wouldn't, couldn't bear it. In fact, he had gone some of the way back to it the very next day, while he was still numb and spinning with shock. He had a broken leg, a couple of broken ribs, some bad burns, and was not really thinking coherently, but had insisted that the village is taken, which uneasily they had. He had not managed to get right to the actual spot where the ground had bubbled and melted, however, and had at last hobbled away from the horror for ever. Soon word had got around that the whole area was haunted, and no one had ventured back there ever since. The land was full of beautiful, verdant, and delightful valleys—no point in going to a highly worrying one. Let the past hold on to itself, and let the present move forward into the future. Random cradled the watch in her hands, slowly turning it to let the long light of the evening sun shine warmly in the scratches and scuffs of the thick glass. It fascinated her, watching the spidery little second hand ticking its way round. Every time it completed a full circle, the longer of the two main hands had moved on exactly to the next of the sixty small divisions round the dial, and when the long hand had made its own full circle, the smaller hand had moved on to the next of the main digits. "'You've been watching it for over an hour,' said Arthur, quietly. "'I know,' she said. "'An hour is when the big hand has gone all the way round, yes?' "'That's right.' "'Then I've been watching it for an hour and seventeen minutes?' She smiled with a deep and mysterious pleasure, and moved very slightly so that she was resting just a little against his arm. Arthur felt that a small sigh escaped from him that had been pent up inside his chest for weeks. He wanted to put his arm round his daughter's shoulders, but felt it was too early yet and that she would shy away from him. But something was working, something was easing inside her. The watch meant something to her that nothing in her life so far had managed to do. Arthur was not sure that he had really understood what it was yet, but he was profoundly pleased and relieved that something had reached her. "'Explain to me again,' said Random. "'There's nothing really to it,' said Arthur. "'Clockwork was something that developed over hundreds of years—' "'Earth-years,' said Random. "'Yes. It became finer and finer, and more and more intricate. It was highly skilled and delicate work. It had to be made very small, and had to carry on working accurately however much you waved it round or dropped it.' "'But only on one planet?' said Random. "'Well, that was where it was made, you see,' said Arthur. "'It was never expected to go anywhere else and deal with different suns and moons and magnetic fields and things. I mean, I think it still goes perfectly well, but doesn't really mean much this far from Switzerland.' "'From where?' "'Switzerland. That's where these things were made. Small, hilly country, tiresomely neat. The people who made them didn't really know there were other worlds.' "'Quite a big thing not to know,' said Random. "'Well, yes,' said Arthur. "'So where did they come from?' "'Well, they, that is, we, just sort of grew there. We evolved on the earth,' said Arthur. "'From, I don't know, some kind of sludge or something.' "'Like this watch,' said Random. "'Oh, I don't think the watch grew out of sludge,' said Arthur. "'You don't understand!' Random suddenly leapt to her feet, shouting. "'You don't understand! You don't understand me! You don't understand anything! I hate you for being so stupid!' She started to run hectically down the hill, still clutching the watch and shouting that she hated him. Arthur jumped up, startled and at a loss. He started to run down after her through the stringy and clumpy grass. It was hard and painful for him. When he had broken his leg in the crash it had not been a clean break and it had not healed cleanly. He was stumbling and wincing as he ran. Suddenly she turned and faced him, her face dark with anger. She brandished a watch at him. "'You don't understand that there's somewhere this belongs, somewhere it works, somewhere that it fits!' She turned and ran again. She was fit and fleet-footed, and Arthur could not remotely keep up with her. It wasn't that he had not expected being a father to be this difficult, it was that he hadn't expected to be a father at all, particularly not suddenly and unexpectedly, on an alien planet. Random turned to shout at him again. For some reason he stopped each time she did. "'Who do you think I am?' she demanded angrily. "'Your upgrade! Who do you think Mum thought I was? Some sort of ticket to the life she didn't have?' "'I don't know what you mean by that,' said Arthur, panting and hurting. "'You don't know what anybody means by anything!' "'What do you mean?' "'Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!' "'Tell me! Please tell me!' said Arthur. "'What do you mean by saying the life she didn't have? She wished she'd stayed on Earth! She wished she hadn't gone off with that stupid brain-dead fruit-gum Zaphod! She thinks she would have had a different life!' "'But,' said Arthur, "'she would have been killed! She would have been killed when the world was destroyed! Well, that's a different life, isn't it?' "'Well, that's... She wouldn't have had to have me! She hates me!' "'You can't mean that! How could anyone possibly... I mean, she had me because I was meant to make things fit for her! That was my job! But I fit it even worse than she did! So she just shut me off and carried on with her stupid life!' "'What's stupid about her life?' insisted Arthur. "'She's fantastically successful, isn't she? She's all over time and space, all over the sub-Ether TV networks. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!' Random turned and ran off again. Arthur couldn't keep up with her, and at last he had to sit down for a bit and let the pain in his legs subside. The turmoil in his head he didn't know what to do with at all. He hobbled into the village an hour later. It was getting dark. The villagers he passed said hello, but there was a sense of nervousness and of not quite knowing what was going on or what to do about it in the air. Old Thrash-Bark had been pulling on his beard a fair bit and looking at the moon, and that was not a good sign either. Arthur went into his hut. Random was sitting hunched quietly over the table. "'I'm sorry,' she said. "'I'm so sorry.' "'That's all right,' said Arthur, as gently as he knew how. It's good to—well, to have a little chat. There's so much we have to learn and understand about each other, and life isn't—well, it isn't all just tea and sandwiches.' "'I'm so sorry,' she said again, sobbing. Arthur went up to her and put his arm around her shoulder. She didn't resist or pull away. Then Arthur saw what it was she was so sorry about. In the pool of light thrown by a Lamuelian lantern lay Arthur's watch. Random had forced the back of it with the back edge of the butter-spreading knife, and all of the minute cogs and springs and levers were lying in a tiny cockeyed mess where she had been fiddling with them. "'I just wanted to see how it worked,' said Random. "'How it all fitted together. I'm so sorry I can't get it back together. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. I'll get it repaired, really, I'll get it repaired.' The following day Thrashbarg came round and said all sorts of Bob stuff. He tried to exert a calming influence by inviting Random to let her mind dwell on the ineffable mystery of the giant ear-wig, and Random said there was no giant ear-wig, and Thrashbarg went very cold and silent, and said she would be cast into the outer darkness. Random said, good, she had been born there. And the next day the parcel arrived. This was all getting a bit eventful. In fact, when the parcel arrived, delivered by a kind of robot drone that dropped out of the sky, making droning robot noises, it brought with it a sense which gradually began to permeate through the whole village that it was almost one event too many. It wasn't the robot drone's fault. All it required was a rather dense signature or thumb-print or just a few scrapings of skin-cells from the nape of his neck, and it would be on its way again. It hung around, waiting, not quite sure what all its resentment meant, but. Meanwhile, Kerp had caught another fish with a head at both ends, but on closer inspection it turned out that it was in fact two fish cut in half and sewn together rather badly. Though not only had Kerp failed to rekindle any great interest in two-headed fish, he had also seriously cast doubt on the authenticity of the first one. Only the picker-birds seemed to feel that everything was exactly normal. The robot drone got Arthur's signature and made its escape. Arthur bore the parcel back to his hut and sat and looked at it. "'Let's open it,' said Random, who was feeling much more cheerful this morning now that everything around her had got thoroughly weird. But Arthur said no. "'Why not? It's not addressed to me.' "'Yes, it is.' "'No, it isn't. It's addressed to—well, it's addressed to Ford Prefect, in care of me.' "'Ford Prefect? Isn't he the one who—' "'Yes,' said Arthur tartly. "'I've heard about him.' "'I expect you have.' "'Well, let's open it anyway. What else are we going to do?' "'I don't know,' said Arthur, who really wasn't sure. He had taken his damaged knives over to the forge bright and early that morning, and Strinder had had a look at them and said that he would see what he could do. They had tried the usual business of waving the knives through the air, feeling for the point of balance and the point of flex, and so on, but the joy was gone from it, and Arthur had a sad feeling that his sandwich-making days were probably numbered. He hung his head. The next appearance of the perfectly normal beast was imminent, but Arthur felt that the usual festivities of hunting and feasting were going to be rather muted and uncertain. Something had happened here on Lamuella, and Arthur had a horrible feeling that it was him. "'What do you think it is?' urged Random, turning the parcel over in her hands. "'I don't know,' said Arthur. "'Something bad and worrying, though.' "'How do you know?' Random protested. "'Because anything that's to do with Ford Prefect is bound to be worse and more worrying than something that isn't,' said Arthur. "'Believe me.' "'You're upset about something, aren't you?' said Random. Arthur sighed. "'I'm just feeling a little jumpy and unsettled, I think,' said Arthur. "'I'm sorry,' said Random, and put the package down again. She could see that it would really upset him if she opened it. She would just have to do it when he wasn't looking.'
 Chapter 8. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It has been compiled and recompiled many times, over many years, and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and researchers. The introduction begins like this. Space, it says, is big—really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen! And so on. After a while the style settles down a bit, and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Beth Salomon is now so worried about the cumulative erosion caused by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your body weight when you leave. So every time you go to the lavatory there it is vitally important to get a receipt. To be fair, though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of the distances between the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in Reading and a small walnut in Idaho and other such dizzying concepts. The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination. Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realise that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars. It takes eight minutes to journey from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol's nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima. For light to reach the other side of the galaxy, for it to reach Damagran, for instance, takes rather longer. Five hundred thousand years. The record for hitchhiking this distance is just under five years, but you don't get to see much on the way. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hyperventilate and then empty your lungs, you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds. However, it does go on to say that, what with space being the mind-boggling size it is, the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand, seven hundred and nine to one against. By a totally staggering coincidence, that is also the telephone number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with. She went off with a gate-crusher. Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat, and the telephone have all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds later, Ford and Arthur were rescued.
 Chapter XIV. The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious perversion of physics, as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules. As the ship's artificial night closed in, they were each grateful to retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts. Trillian couldn't sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage which contained her last and only links with Earth, two white mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had never expected to see the planet again, but she was disturbed by her negative reaction to the news of the planet's destruction. It seemed remote and unreal, and she could find no thoughts to think about it. She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little plastic tread-wheels till they occupied her whole attention. Suddenly she shook herself and went back on to the bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures that charted the ship's progress through the void. She wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think about. Zaphod couldn't sleep. He also wished that he knew what it was that he wouldn't let himself think about. For as long as he could remember he had suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there. Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside and not worry about it, but it had been reawakened by the sudden inexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn't see. Zaphod couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the road again. Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over just as he was finally beginning to give up hope. Knocking about with Zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed to be something faintly odd about his semi-cousin that he couldn't put his finger on. The fact that he had become President of the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post. Was there a reason behind it? There would be no point in asking Zaphod. He never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all. He had turned unfathomability into an art form. He had tagged everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence, and it was often difficult to tell which was which. Arthur slept. He was terribly tired. There was a tap at Zaphod's door. It slid open. Zaphod? Yeah? Trillian stood outlined in the oval of light. I think we just found what we came to look for. Hey! Yeah? Ford gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was a small computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while and tried to compose a new entry for the guide on the subject of Vogons, but couldn't think of anything vitriolic enough, so he gave that up too, wrapped a robe around himself, and went for a walk to the bridge. As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched excitedly over the instruments. See, the ship's about to move into orbit, Trillian was saying. There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you predicted. Zaphod heard a noise and looked up. Ford! he hissed. Hey, come and have a look at this. Ford went over and had a look at it. It was a series of figures flickering over a screen. You recognize those galactic coordinates? said Zaphod. No. I'll give you a clue. Computer? Hi, gang! enthused the computer. This is getting real sociable, isn't it? Shut up, said Zaphod, and show us the screens. Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor screens. There was absolutely nothing on them. Recognize that? whispered Zaphod. Ford frowned. No, he said. What do you see? Nothing. Recognize it? What are you talking about? We're in the Horsehead Nebula, one whole vast dark cloud. And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen? Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the galaxy you'd see a dark screen. Very good. Ford laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so. Hey, this is really terrific. This is just far too much. What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud? said Ford. What would you reckon to find here? urged Zaphod. Nothing. No stars? No planets? No. Computer! shouted Zaphod. Change angle of vision through 180 degrees and don't talk about it. For a moment it seemed that nothing was happening. Then a brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the size of a small plate crept across it, followed quickly by another one, a binary system. Then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of the picture, a red glare shading away into deep black, the night side of the planet. I found it! cried Zaphod, thumping the console. I found it! Ford stared at it in astonishment. What is it? he said. That, said Zaphod, is the most improbable planet that ever existed.
 CHAPTER XIX Are we taking this robot with us? said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin, who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm-tree. Zaford glanced away from the mirror-screens, which presented a panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of Gold had now landed. Oh, the paranoid android! he said. Yeah, we'll take him. But what are you supposed to do with a manically depressed robot? You think you've got problems, said Marvin, as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin. What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that. I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you, and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level. Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin. My white mice have escaped, she said. An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaford's faces. Nuts to your white mice, he said. Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again. It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realised that human beings were only the third most intelligent life-form present on the planet earth, instead of, as is generally thought by most independent observers, the second. Good afternoon, boys. The voice was oddly familiar but oddly different. It had a matriarchal twang. It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them out onto the planet's surface. They looked at each other in puzzlement. At the computer, explained Zaford, I discovered it had an emergency backup personality that I thought might work out better. Now, this is going to be your first day out on a strange new planet, continued Eddie's new voice, so I want you all wrapped up snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed monsters. Zaford tapped impatiently on the hatch. I'm sorry, he said. I think we might be better off with a slide rule. Right, snapped the computer. Who said that? Will you open up the exit hatch, please, computer? said Zaford, trying not to get angry. Not until whoever said that owns up, urged the computer, stamping a few snaps is closed. Oh, God, muttered Ford, slumped against a bulkhead and started to count to ten. He was desperately worried that one day sentient life-forms would forget how to do this. Only by counting could humans demonstrate their independence of computers. Come on, said Eddie sternly. Computer, began Zaford. I'm waiting, interrupted Eddie. I can wait all day if necessary. Computer, said Zaford again, who had been trying to think of some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground. If you don't open that exit hatch this moment, I shall zap straight off to your major databanks and reprogram you with a very large axe. Got that? Eddie shocked, paused and considered this. Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying, Blood, blood, blood, blood. Finally, Eddie said quietly, I can see this relationship is something we're all going to have to work at. And the hatchway opened. An icy wind ripped into them. They hugged themselves warmly and stepped down the ramp onto the barren dust of Magrathir. It'll all end in tears, I know it, shouted Eddie after them and closed the hatchway again. A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again in response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise.
 Chapter 30 So there you have it, said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study. He picked up a piece of paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn't think of anywhere else to put it, so he put it back on top of the original pile, which promptly fell over. Deep thought designed the earth. We built it, and you lived on it. And the Vogons came and destroyed it, five minutes before the programme was completed, added Arthur, not unbitterly. Yes, said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room, ten million years of planning and work gone just like that. Ten million years, earthman! Can you conceive of that kind of time span? A galactic civilisation could grow from a single worm five times over in that time. Go on, he paused. Well, that's bureaucracy for you, he added. You know, said Arthur thoughtfully, all this explains a lot of things. All through my life I've had the strange, unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was. Oh no, said the old man, that's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the universe has that. Everyone, said Arthur. Well, if everyone has that, perhaps it means something, perhaps somewhere outside the universe we know— Maybe. Who cares? said Slartibart fast before Arthur got too excited. Perhaps I'm old and tired, he continued, but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is, say, hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me. I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway. He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block with his name on it and the model of Norway moulded into it. Where's the sense in that? he said. None that I've been able to make out. I've been doing fjords all my life. For a fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award. He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly, but not so carelessly that it didn't land on something soft. In this replacement earth we're building they've given me Africa to do, and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them and I'm old-fashioned enough to think they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent, and they tell me it's not equatorial enough. Equatorial! he gave a hollow laugh. What does it matter? Science has achieved some wonderful things, of course, but I'd far rather be happy than right any day. And are you? No, that's where it all falls down, of course. Pity, said Arthur with sympathy. Sounds like quite a good lifestyle otherwise. Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed. Come, said Slartibartfast, you are to meet the mice. Your arrival on the planet has caused considerable excitement. It has already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the history of the universe. What were the first two? said Arthur. Oh, probably just coincidences, said Slartibartfast carelessly. He opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow. Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning. I seem to be having this tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle, he muttered to himself. I beg your pardon? asked the old man mildly. Oh, nothing, said Arthur, only joking.
 New Millennium Audio presents The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. Read by the author.
 Chapter 35 That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light-years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm-tree on the bridge, trying to bang his brain into shape with massive pan-galactic gargle-blasters. Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it, and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Since he was going to have to live in the place, he reasoned, he'd better start finding out something about it. He came across this entry. It said, The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of survival, inquiry, and sophistication, otherwise known as the how, why, and where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question, How can we eat? the second by the question, Why do we eat? and the third by the question, Where shall we have lunch? He got no further before the ship's intercom buzzed into life. Hey, Earthman, you hungry, kid? said Zaphod's voice. Er, well, yes, a little peckish, I suppose, said Arthur. Okay, baby, hold tight, said Zaphod. We'll take in a quick bite at the restaurant at the end of the universe.
 33 But the end never came—at least not then. Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and a thud. The four stared at each other. What happened?" said Arthur. "'They stopped,' said Zaphod, with a shrug. "'Why?' "'Dunno. You want to go and ask them?' "'Nope.' They waited. "'Hello?' called out Ford. No answer. "'That's odd. Perhaps it's a trap. They haven't the wit. What were those thuds?' "'Dunno.' They waited for a few more seconds. "'Right,' said Ford. "'I'm going to have a look.' He glanced round at the others. "'Is no one going to say, no, you can't possibly let me go instead?' They all shook their heads. "'Oh, well,' he said, and stood up. For a moment nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer. Cautiously he stepped out into the open. Still nothing happened. Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space-suited figure of one of the cops. He was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground. Twenty yards in the other direction lay the second man. No one else was anywhere to be seen. This struck Ford as being extremely odd. Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one. The body lay reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it, and put his foot down on the kilo-zap gun that still dangled from its limp fingers. He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance. The cop was quite clearly dead. A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa. He was a methane-breeding life-form, dependent on his space-suit for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea. The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have blown up. Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment. These miniature suit computers usually had the full backup of the main computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked through the sub-ether. Such a system was fail-safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of. He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably simultaneously. He called the others over to look. They came, shared his astonishment, but not his curiosity. "'Let's get shot of this hole,' said Zayford. "'If whatever I'm supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it.' He grabbed the second killer-zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer, and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others. He very nearly blasted hell out of an air-car that stood waiting for them a few yards away. The air-car was empty, but Arthur recognised it as belonging to Slartibartfast. It had a note from him, pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel. The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls. It said, "'This is probably the best button to press.'"
 Chapter 34 The air-car rocketed the speeds in excess of R-17 through the steel tunnels that led out onto the appalling surface of the planet, which is now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight. Ghastly grey light congealed on the land. R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, well-being, and not being more than, say, five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure, according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tranquillity, this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers, and even death. R-17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast. The air-car flung itself through the air at R-17 and above, deposited them next to the heart of gold, which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important business of its own. Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship. Beside it stood another one. It was the Blagelan Kappa police-craft, a bulbous shark-like affair, slate green in colour, and smothered with black stenciled letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness. The letters informed anyone who cared to read them as to where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power-feeds should be connected. It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two-man crew was at that moment lying asphyxiated in a smoke-filled chamber several miles beneath the ground. It is one of those curious things that are impossible to explain or define, but one can sense when a ship is completely dead. Ford could sense it, and found it most mysterious. A ship and two policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead. In his experience the universe simply didn't work like that. The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold even more, and hurried back into the heart of gold, suffering from an acute attack of no curiosity. Ford stayed and went to examine the Blageland ship. As he walked he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust. "'Marvin,' he exclaimed, "'what are you doing?' "'Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please,' came a muffled drone. "'But how are you, metal man?' said Ford, very depressed. "'What's up?' "'I don't know,' said Marvin. "'I've never been there.' "'Why?' said Ford, squatting down beside him and shivering. "'Are you lying face down in the dust?' "'It's a very effective way of being wretched,' said Marvin. "'Don't pretend you want to talk to me. I know you hate me.' "'I don't?' "'Yes, you do. Everyone does. It's part of the shape of the universe. I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me. Even robots hate me. If you just ignore me, I expect I shall probably go away.' He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction. "'That ship hated me,' he said dejectedly, indicating the police-craft. "'That ship?' said Ford in sudden excitement. ''What happened to it? Do you know?' "'It hated me because I talked to it.' "'You talked to it?' exclaimed Ford. "'What do you mean, you talked to it?' "'Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself into its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the universe to it,' said Marvin. "'And what happened?' pressed Ford. "'It committed suicide,' said Marvin, and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold.'
 Chapter 13 Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning. "'And then, of course, I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left-hand side.' "'No,' said Arthur, grimly, as he walked along beside him. "'Really?' "'Oh, yes,' said Marvin. "'I mean, I've asked for them to be replaced, but no one ever listens. I can imagine.' Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. "'Well, well, well,' he kept on saying to himself, "'Zayford Beeblebrox!' Suddenly Marvin stopped and held up a hand. "'You know what's happened now, of course?' "'No. What?' said Arthur, who didn't want to know. "'We've arrived at another of those doors.' There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor. Marvin eyed it suspiciously. "'Well,' said Ford, impatiently, "'do we go through? Do we go through?' "'Wait, Marvin. Yes. This is the entrance to the bridge. I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today, I shouldn't wonder.' Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a hunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid open. "'Thank you,' it said, 'for making a simple door very happy.' Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground. "'Funny,' he intoned funerally, 'how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse, it suddenly does.' He heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur staring at each other and shrugging their shoulders. From inside they heard Marvin's voice again. "'I suppose you'll want to see the aliens now,' he said. "'Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm standing?' "'Yeah, just show them in, would you, Marvin?' came another voice. Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing. "'What's—' "'Shh,' said Ford. Come on in.' He stepped through onto the bridge. Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console, picking the teeth in his right-hand head with his left hand. The right-hand head seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with his task, but the left-hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed, nonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn't believe he was seeing was fairly large. His jaw flopped about at a loose end for a while. The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford, and with an appalling affectation of nonchalance said, "'Ford, hi! How are you? Glad you could drop in.' Ford was not going to be out-cooled. "'Say, Ford,' he drawled, "'Great to see you. You're looking well. The extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've stolen.' Arthur goggled at him. "'You mean you know this guy?' he said, waving a wild finger at Zafod. "'Know him!' exclaimed Ford. "'He's—' He paused and decided to do the introductions the other way round. "'Oh, Zafod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent,' he said. "'I saved him when his planet blew up.' "'Oh, sure,' said Zafod. "'Hi, Arthur. Glad you could make it.' His right-hand head looked round casually and said, "'Hi,' and went back to having his teeth picked. Ford carried on. "'And, Arthur,' he said, "'this is my semi-cousin, Zafod Beeb. We've met,' said Arthur sharply. When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard-driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from fourth to first instead of third, thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off your stride, in much the same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect off his. "'Uh, what?' he said. "'I said we've met.' Zafod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply. "'Hey, uh, have we? Eh, huh?' Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he felt he was back on home ground, he suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive, who knew as much about the affairs of the galaxy as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life in Peking. "'What do you mean you've met?' he demanded. "'This is Zafod Beeblebrox from Beetlejuice Five, you know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon.' "'I don't care,' said Arthur coldly. "'We've met, haven't we, Zafod Beeblebrox? Or should I say Phil?' "'What?' shouted Ford. "'You'll have to remind me,' said Zafod. 'I've a terrible memory for species.' "'It was at a party,' pursued Arthur. "'Yeah, well, I doubt that,' said Zafod. "'Cool it, will you, Arthur?' demanded Ford. Arthur would not be deterred. "'A party six months ago on earth. England!' Zafod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile. "'London,' insisted Arthur. "'Islington.' "'Oh!' said Zafod with a guilty star. "'Oh, that party!'' This wasn't fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards between Arthur and Zafod. "'What?' he said to Zafod. "'You don't mean to say you've been on that miserable little planet as well, do you?' "'No, of course not,' said Zafod breezily. "'Well, I may have just dropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere.' "'But I was stuck there for fifteen years,' said Ford. "'Well, I didn't know that, did I?' "'But what were you doing there?' "'Oh, looking about, you know.' "'He gate-crashed a party,' said Arthur, trembling with anger. "'A fancy-dress party.' "'Well, it would have to be, wouldn't it?' said Ford. "'At this party,' persisted Arthur, "'was a girl.' "'Oh, well, look, it doesn't matter now, and the whole place has gone up in smoke anyway. "'I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet,' said Ford. "'Who was the lady?' "'Oh, just somebody. "'Well, all right. I wasn't doing very well with her. "'I'd been trying all evening. "'Hell, she was something, though. "'Beautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent. "'At last I'd got to her to myself for a bit and was plying her with a bit of talk, "'when this friend of yours barges up and says, "'Hey, doll, is this guy boring you? "'Why don't you talk to me instead? "'I'm from a different planet.' "'I never saw her again.' "'Zafod!' exclaimed Ford. "'Yes!' said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. "'He only had the two arms and the one head, and he called himself Phil, "'but you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet,' said Trillian, "'wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge.' "'She gave Arthur a pleasant smile, which settled on him like a ton of bricks, "'and then turned her attention to the ship's controls again. "'There was silence for a few seconds, "'and then out of the scrambled mess of Arthur's brain crawled some words. "'Tricia Macmillan,' he said. "'What are you doing here?' "'Same as you,' she said. "'I hitched a lift. "'After all, with a degree in maths and another in astrophysics, "'what else was there to do? "'It was either that or the doll queue again on Monday.' "'Infinity minus one,' chatted the computer. "'Improbability sum now complete.' "'Zafod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian. "'Trillian,' he said. "'Is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the Improbability Drive?' "'Very probably, I'm afraid,' she said. "'I'm afraid it's not going to happen every time we use the Improbability Drive.' "'I'm afraid it's not going to happen every time we use the Improbability Drive.' "'I'm afraid it's not going to happen every time we use the Improbability Drive.' "'I'm afraid it's not going to happen every time we use the Improbability Drive.' "'I'm afraid it's not going to happen every time we use the Improbability Drive.' "'I'm afraid it's not going to happen every time we use the Improbability Drive.'
 XXVII Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public library. The old man frowned as they stepped in. "'Terribly unfortunate,' he said. "'A diode blew in one of the life-support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered they had been dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who's going to clear away the bodies? That's what I want to know. Look, why don't you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in?' He gestured Arthur towards a chair, which looked as if it had been made out of the ribcage of a stegosaurus. "'It was made out of the ribcage of a stegosaurus,' explained the old man, as he potted about, fishing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments. "'Here,' he said, "'hold these,' and passed a couple of stripped wire-ends to Arthur. The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him. He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself. Beneath him was a pretty tree-lined square, and all around it, as far as the eye could see, were white concrete buildings of airy, spacious design, but somewhat the worse for wear. Many were cracked and stained with rain. Today, however, the sun was shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful, excited people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the breeze, and the spirit of carnival was in the air. Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely, stuck up in the air above it all, without so much as a body to his name. But before he had time to reflect on this, a voice rang out across the square and called for everyone's attention. A man, standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly dominated the square, was addressing the crowd over a tannoy. "'O people who wait in the shadow of deep thought!' he cried out. "'Honoured descendants of Vroomfondel and Magickthise, the greatest and most truly interesting pundits the universe has ever known, the time of waiting is over!' Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowds. Flags, streamers and wolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air. "'Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this great and hopefully enlightening day!' cried the cheerleader. "'The day of the answer!' Haraz burst from the ecstatic crowd. "'Never again!' cried the man. "'Never again will we wake up in the morning and think, who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work? For today we will finally learn, once and for all, the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of life, the universe and everything!' As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd. He experienced a moment's panic as he sailed straight towards the window, which passed a second or so later when he found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently touching it. No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly surprising as he wasn't there. He began to realise that the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track 70mm into a cocked hat. The room was much as Slartibart had described it. In seven and a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century or so. The ultra-mahogany desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk's leather top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday. Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited. "'The time is nearly upon us,' said one. And Arthur was surprised to see a word suddenly materialise in thin air just by the man's neck. The word was LUNQUAL, and it flashed a couple of times and then disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate this, the other man spoke, and the word FALC appeared by his neck. "'Seventy-five thousand generations ago our ancestors set this programme in motion,' the second man said. And in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak.' "'An awesome prospect, Falc,' agreed the first man. And Arthur suddenly realised he was watching a recording with subtitles. "'We are the first ones who will hear,' said Falc, ''the answer to the great question of life.' "'The universe,' said LUNQUAL. "'And everything!' said LUNQUAL with a slight gesture. "'I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak.' There was a moment's expectant pause, whilst panels slowly came to life on front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally, and settled down into a business-like pattern. A soft, low hum came from the communication channel. "'Good morning,' said Deep Thought at last. "'Good morning, oh, Deep Thought,' said LUNQUAL nervously. "'Do you have—' "'That is—' "'An answer for you,' interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "'Yes, I have.' The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain. "'There really is one?' breathed Falc. "'There really is one,' confirmed Deep Thought. "'To everything? To the great question of life, the universe, and everything?' "'Yes.' "'Yes.' Both of the men had been trained for this moment. Their lives had been a preparation for it. They had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children. "'And are you ready to give it to us?' urged LUNQUAL. "'I am.' "'Now?' "'Now,' said Deep Thought. They both licked their dry lips. "'Though I don't think,' added Deep Thought, "'that you're going to like it.' "'Doesn't matter,' said Falc. "'We must know it—now.' "'Now?' inquired Deep Thought. "'Yes, now.' "'All right,' said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable. "'You're really not going to like it,' observed Deep Thought. "'Tell us.' "'All right,' said Deep Thought. "'The answer to the great question—' "'Yes.' "'—of life, the universe, and everything—' "'Yes.' "'—said Deep Thought. "'Yes.' "'—is—' "'Yes.' "'—said Deep Thought, and paused. "'Yes.' "'—is—' "'Yes.' "'Forty-two!' "'said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.
 XXVI. Yes, very salutary," said Arthur, after Slartibartfuss had related the salient points of the story to him. "'But I don't understand what all this has got to do with the earth and mice and things.' "'That is but the first half of the story, Earthman,' said the old man. "'If you would care to discover what happened seven and a half million years later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me to invite you to my study, where you can experience the events yourself on our sensor-tape records. That is, unless you would care to take a quick stroll on the surface of New Earth. It's only half completed, I'm afraid. We haven't even finished burying the artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet. Then we have the tertiary and quaternary periods of the Cenozoic era to lay down and—' "'No, thank you,' said Arthur. 'It wouldn't be quite the same.' "'No,' said Slartibartfuss, it isn't.' Then he turned the air-car round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall.
 Chapter 17 After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was beginning to reassemble itself from the shell-shocked fragments the previous day had left him with. He had found a nutrimatic machine, which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was pressed, it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism, and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject's brain to see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did this, because it invariably delivered a cup full of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The nutrimatic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, whose complaints department now covers all the major landmasses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tor star system. Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at the screens again, and watched a few more hundred miles of barren grayness slide past. It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him. "'Is it safe?' he said. "'Ah, Magrathia has been dead for five million years,' said Zayford. "'Of course it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now.' At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge, a noise as of a distant fanfare, a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy, and insubstantial. The voice said, "'Greetings to you.' Someone from the dead planet was talking to them. "'Computer!' shouted Zayford. "'Hi there!' "'What the photon is it?' "'Oh, just some five-million-year-old tape that's been broadcast at us.' "'A what? A recording?' "'Shh!' said Ford. It's carrying on.' The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with quite unmistakable menace. "'This is a recorded announcement,' it said, "'as I'm afraid we're all out at the moment. The Commercial Council of Magrathia thanks you for your esteemed visit.' "'A voice from ancient Magrathia!' shouted Zayford. "'Okay, okay,' said Ford. "'But regrets,' continued the voice, 'that the entire planet is temporarily closed for visitors. Thank you. If you would care to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone.' A short buzz followed, then silence. "'They want to get rid of us,' said Trillian nervously. "'What do we do?' "'It's just a recording,' said Zayford. "'We keep going. Got that, computer?' "'I got it,' said the computer, and gave the ship an extra kick of speed. They waited. For a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice. "'We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed, announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to select from all that's best in contemporary geography.' The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge. Meanwhile, we thank our clients for their kind interest, and would ask them to leave. Now—' Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions. "'Well, I suppose we'd better be going, then, hadn't we?' he suggested. "'Shh!' said Zayford. "'There's absolutely nothing to be worried about.' "'Then why is everyone so tense?' "'They're just interested!' shouted Zayford. "'Computer, start a descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing.' This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice now distinctly cold. "'It is most gratifying,' it said, "'that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail. We look forward to your custom in future lives. Thank you.' The voice snapped off. "'Oh,' said Trillian. "'Er,' said Arthur. "'Well?' said Ford. "'Look,' said Zayford, "'will you get it into your heads? That's just a recorded message. It's millions of years old. It doesn't apply to us. Get it?' "'What?' said Trillian quietly, about the missiles. "'Missiles! Don't make me laugh!' Ford tapped Zayford on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen. There in the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship. A quick change of magnification brought them into close focus, two massively real rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it was shocking. "'I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to us,' said Ford. Zayford stared at them in astonishment. "'Hey! This is terrific!' he said. "'Someone down there is trying to kill us!' "'Terrific!' said Arthur. "'But don't you see what this means?' "'Yes, we're going to die!' "'Yes, yes, but apart from that!' "'Apart from that?' "'It means we must be on to something!' "'How soon can we get off it?' Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen grew larger. They had swung round onto a direct homing course, so that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head on. "'As a matter of interest,' said Trillian, "'what are we going to do?' "'Just keep cool!' said Zayford. "'Is that all?' shouted Arthur. "'No, we're also going to, uh, uh, take evasive action!' said Zayford with a sudden access of panic. "'Uh, computer, uh, what evasive action can we take?' "'Uh, none, I'm afraid, guys!' said the computer. "'Uh, or something,' said Zayford. "'Uh,' he said. "'There seems to be something jamming my guidance systems,' explained the computer brightly. "'Impact minus forty-five seconds. Please call me Eddie if it'll help you relax!' Zayford tried to run in several equally decisive directions simultaneously. "'Right,' he said. "'Uh, we've got to get manual control of this ship!' "'Can you fly her?' asked Ford pleasantly. "'No, can you?' "'No.' "'Trillian, can you?' "'No.' "'Fine,' said Zayford, relaxing. 'We'll do it together.' "'I can't either,' said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert himself. "'I guess that,' said Zayford. "'Okay, computer, I want full manual control now.' "'You got it!' said the computer. Several large desk panels slid open, and banks of control consoles sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-up cellophane. These controls had never been used before. Zayford stared at them wildly. "'Okay, Ford,' he said. ''Full retro-thrust and ten-degree starboard, uh, or something.' "'Good luck, guys!' chirped the computer. "'Impact minus thirty seconds!' Ford leapt to the controls. Only a few of them made any immediate sense to him, so he pulled those. The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocket jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously. He released half of them, and the ship spun round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the oncoming missiles. Air-cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces held them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move. Zayford struggled and pushed in manic desperation, and finally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system. The lever snapped off. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards. The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin. Ford's copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the console, with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarian parakeet glands out of Antares—an Antarian parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much sought-after cocktail delicacy, and very large sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots—and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone. It was, of course, more or less at this point that one of the crew sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be emphasised because, as has already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed, and the deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is absolutely assured. "'Impact minus twenty seconds, guys,' said the computer. "'Turn the bloody engines back on!' bawled Zaphod. "'Oh, sure thing, guys,' said the computer. With the subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again. The computer started to sing. "'When you walk through the storm,' it whined nasally, "'hold your head up high!' Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the dim of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction. "'And don't be afraid of the dark,' Eddie wailed. The ship, in flattening out, had in fact flattened out upside down, and lying on the ceiling as they were, it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems. "'At the end of the storm,' crooned Eddie. The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship. "'Is a golden sky!' But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it. "'And the sweet silver song of the lark. "'Revised impact time fifteen seconds, fellas. "'Walk on through the wind!' The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back in pursuit. "'This is it!' said Arthur, watching them. "'We are now quite definitely going to die, aren't we?' "'We should stop saying that,' shouted Ford. "'Well, we are, aren't we?' "'Yes!' "'Walk on through the rain!' sang Eddie. A thought struck Arthur. He struggled to his feet. "'Why doesn't anyone turn on the sim-probability-drive thing?' he said. "'We could probably reach that.' "'What, are you crazy?' said Zaphod. "'Without proper programming anything could happen.' "'Does that matter at this stage?' shouted Arthur. "'May your dreams be tossed and blown!' sang Eddie. Arthur scrambled up onto one of the excitingly chunky pieces of moulded contouring, where the curve of the wall met the ceiling. "'Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart!' "'Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the improbability-drive?' shouted Trillian. "'And you'll never walk alone!' "'Impact minus five seconds. "'It's been great knowing you guys. "'God bless!' "'You'll never walk alone!' "'I said!' yelled Trillian. "'Does anyone know?' The next thing that happened was a mind-mangling explosion of noise and light.
 Chapter XXXI It is, of course, well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated. For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said, I seem to be having this tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle, a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his words far, far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle. The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vlahergs, resplendent in his black jeweled battle-shorts, gazed levelly at the Gugugvunt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green, sweet-smelling steam, and with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star-cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother. The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that moment the words, I seem to be having this tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle, drifted across the conference table. Unfortunately in the Vlaherg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries. Eventually, of course, after their galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realised that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle-fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our galaxy, now positively identified as the source of the offending remark. For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space, and finally dived screaming onto the first planet they came across, which happened to be the earth, where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle-fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog. Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it. It's just life, they say. A short air-car trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathian to a doorway. They left the car and went through the door into a waiting-room full of glass-topped tables and perspex awards. Almost immediately a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room, and they entered. "'Arthur, you're safe!' a voice cried. "'Am I?' said Arthur, rather startled. "'Oh, good!' The lighting was rather subdued, and it took him a moment or so to see Ford, Trillian, and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats, and bizarre fruits. They were stuffing their faces. "'What happened to you?' demanded Arthur. "'Oh, well,' said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, "'our hosts here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird, and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us. Here,' he said, hoiking out a lump of evil-smelling meat from a bowl, "'have some vegan rhino's cutlet. It's delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing.' "'Hosts?' said Arthur. "'What hosts? I don't see any.' A small voice said, "'Welcome to lunch, earth-creature.' Arthur glanced round him, and suddenly yelped. "'Ah!' he said. "'There are mice on the table!' There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur. He was busy staring at two white mice, sitting in what looked like whisky-glasses on the table. He heard the silence and glanced round at everyone. "'Oh!' he said, with sudden realisation. "'Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't quite prepared for—' "'Let me introduce you,' said Trillian. "'Arthur, this is Benjy Mouse.' "'Hi,' said one of the mice. His whiskers stroked what must have been a touch-sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky-glass-like affair, and it moved forward slightly. "'And this is Frankie Mouse.' The other mouse said, "'Pleased to meet you,' and did likewise. Arthur gaped. "'But aren't they—' "'Yes,' said Trillian. "'They are the mice I brought with me from the earth.' She looked him in the eye, and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug. "'Could you pass me the bowl of Greater Duck Tear and Mega Donkey?' she said. Slarty Bartfast coughed politely. "'Er—excuse me,' he said. "'Yes, thank you, Slarty Bartfast,' said Benjy Mouse sharply. "'You may go.' "'What? Oh, er—' "'Oh, er—very well,' said the old man, slightly taken aback. "'I'll just go and get on with some of my fjords, then.' "'Ah, well, in fact that won't be necessary,' said Frankie Mouse. "'It looks very much as if we won't be needing the new earth any longer.' He swivelled his pink little eyes. "'Not now that we have found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed.' "'What?' "'What?' cried Slarty Bartfast aghast. "'You can't mean that. I've got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa.' "'Well, perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle them,' said Frankie acidly. "'Skiing holiday!' cried the old man. "'Those glaciers are works of art—elegantly sculpted contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines. It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art.' "'Thank you, Slarty Bartfast,' said Benjy firmly. "'That will be all.' "'Yes, sir,' said the old man coldly. "'Thank you very much. Well, good-bye, earth-man,' he said to Arthur. "'Hope the lifestyle comes together.' With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked sadly out of the room. Arthur stared after him, not knowing what to say. "'Now,' said Benjy Mouse, "'to business.' Ford and Zephyr clinked their glasses together. "'To business,' they said. "'I beg your pardon,' said Benjy. Ford looked round. "'Oh, sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast,' he said. The two mice scuttled impatiently round in their glass transports. Finally they composed themselves, and Benjy moved forward to address Arthur. "'Now, earth-creature,' he said, "'the situation we have in effect is this. We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called the ultimate question.' "'Why?' said Arthur sharply. "'No, we already thought of that one,' said Frankie, interrupting. "'But it doesn't fit the answer. Why?' "'Forty-two.' "'You see, it doesn't work.' "'No,' said Arthur. "'I mean, why have you been doing it?' "'Oh, I see,' said Frankie. "'Well, eventually, just habit, I think, to be brutally honest. And this is more or less the point. We're sick to the teeth of the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those winnet-ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heebie-jeebies. Know what I mean? It was by the merest lucky chance that Benjy and I finished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathir by the good officers of your friends.' "'Magrathir is a gateway back to our own dimension,' put in Benjy. "'Since when,' continued his Murine colleague, 'we've had an offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5-D chat-show and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and we're very much inclined to take it.' "'I would, wouldn't you, Ford?' said Zaphod promptingly. "'Oh, yes,' said Ford. 'Jump at it, like a shot.' Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to. "'But we've got to have product, you see,' said Frankie. "'I mean, ideally we still need the ultimate question in some form or other.' Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur. "'You see,' he said, "'if they're just sitting there in the studio, looking very relaxed, you know, just mentioning that they happen to know the answer to life, the universe and everything, and then just eventually have to admit that in fact it's 42, then the show is probably quite short. I mean, no follow-up, you see.' "'We have to have something that sounds good,' said Benjy. "'Something that sounds good!' exclaimed Arthur. "'An ultimate question that sounds good, from a couple of mice!' The mice bristled. "'Well, I mean, yes, idealism, yes, the dignity of pure research, yes, the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point, I'm afraid, where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth it's that the entire multidimensional infinity of the universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between spending another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise,' said Frankie. "'But,' started Arthur hopelessly. "'Hey, will you get this, Earthman?' interrupted Zayford. "'You are a last generation product of that computer matrix, right? And you were there right up to the moment that your planet got the finger, yeah?' "'Er,' said Arthur uncertainly. "'So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer program,' said Ford. "'Rather lucidly,' he thought. "'Right?' said Zayford. "'Well,' said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn't aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything. He always felt this was one of his problems. "'In other words,' said Benjy, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, "'there's a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain, so we want to buy it off you.' "'What, the question?' said Arthur. "'Yes,' said Ford and Trillian. "'For lots of money,' said Zayford. "'No, no,' said Frankie. "'It's the brain we want to buy.' "'What?' "'Well, who would miss it?' inquired Benjy. "'I thought you said you could just read his brain electronically,' protested Ford. "'Oh, yes,' said Frankie. "'But we'd have to get it out first. It's got to be prepared.' "'Treated,' said Benjy. "'Diced!' "'Thank you!' shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away from the table in horror. "'It could always be replaced,' said Benjy reasonably, "'if you think it's important.' "'Yes, an electronic brain,' said Frankie. "'A simple one would suffice.' "'A simple one?' wailed Arthur. "'Yeah,' said Zayford, with a sudden evil grin. "'You'd just have to programme it to say, uh, what and I don't understand and where's the T. Who'd know the difference?' "'What?' cried Arthur, backing away still further. "'See what I mean?' said Zayford, and howled with pain because of something that Trillian did at that moment. "'I'd notice the difference,' said Arthur. "'No, you wouldn't,' said Frankie Mouse. "'You'd be programmed not to.' Ford made for the door. "'Look, I'm sorry, my soul lads,' he said. 'I don't think we've got a deal.' "'I'd rather think we have to have a deal,' said the mice in chorus, all the charm vanishing from their piping little voices in an instant. With a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the table and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think of anything. Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him towards the door, which Ford and Zayford were struggling to open, but Arthur was dead weight. He seemed hypnotised by the airborne rodents swooping towards him. She screamed at him, but he just gaped. With one more yank, Ford and Zayford got the door open. On the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men, who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathir. Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty. They charged. So Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zayford were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were. All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an ear-splitting din.
 Chapter 6 Chapter 7 Message ends. The noise stopped. Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped around his head. He smiled weakly. Charming man, he said. I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one. You wouldn't need to, said Ford. They've got as much sex appeal as a road accident. No, don't move, he added as Arthur began to uncurl himself. You'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk. What's so unpleasant about being drunk, said Arthur? You ask a glass of water. Arthur thought about this. Ford, he said. Yep. What's this fish doing in my ear? It's translating for you. It's a babel fish. Look it up in the book if you like. He tossed over the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and then curled himself up into a fetal ball to prepare himself for the jump. At that moment, the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind. His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head. The room folded flat around him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own navel. They were passing through hyperspace. The babel fish, said the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy quietly, is small, yellow and leech-like and probably the oddest thing in the universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centers of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a babel fish in your ear, you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your babel fish. Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clenching proof of the non-existence of God. The argument goes something like this. I refuse to prove that I exist, says God, for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing. But, says man, the babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore by your own arguments you don't QED. Oh dear, says God, I hadn't thought of that, and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic. Oh, that was easy, says man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing. Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingoes' kidneys, but that didn't stop Ulan Qalufid making a small fortune when he used it as a central theme for his best-selling book, Well, That About Wraps It Up For God. Meanwhile, the poor babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation. Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the kick through hyperspace hadn't killed him. He was now six light-years from the place that the earth would have been if it still existed. The earth. Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole earth having gone. It was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction. Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the supermarket two days before and felt a sudden stab. The supermarket was gone. Everyone in it was gone. Nelson's Column had gone. Nelson's Column had gone and there would be no outcry. Because there was no one left to make an outcry. From now on, Nelson's Column only existed in his mind. England only existed in his mind. His mind stuck here in this dank, smelly, steel-lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia closed in on him. England no longer existed. He'd got that. Somehow he'd got it. He tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn't grasp it. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He never seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, has sunk forever. Slight tremor there. Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. McDonald's, he thought. There is no longer any such thing as a McDonald's hamburger. He passed out. When he came round a second later, he found that he was sobbing for his mother. He jerked himself violently to his feet. Ford! Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner, humming to himself. He always found the actual travelling through space part of space travel rather trying. Yeah, he said. If you're a researcher on this book thing, and you're on Earth, you must have been gathering material on it. Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes. Let me see what it says in this edition, then. I've got to see it. Yeah, OK. Ford passed it over again. Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. He pressed the entry for the relevant page. The screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it. It doesn't have an entry, he burst out. Ford looked over his shoulder. Yes, it does, he said. Look, down there. See it, the bottom of the screen? Just under Eccentric Golumbitz, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6. Arthur followed Ford's finger and saw where it was pointing. For a moment it still didn't register. Then his mind nearly blew up. What? Harmless? Is that all it's got to say? Harmless? One word? Ford shrugged. Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors, he said. And no-one knew much about the Earth, of course. Well, for God's sake, I hope you managed to rectify that a bit. Oh, yes, well, I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor. He had to trim it a bit, but it's still an improvement. And what does it say now? asked Arthur. Mostly harmless, admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough. Mostly harmless? shouted Arthur. What was that noise? hissed Ford. It was me shouting! shouted Arthur. No, no, no, shut up, said Ford. I think we're in trouble. You think we're in trouble! Outside the door were the clear sounds of marching footsteps. Bidentrassi? whispered Arthur. No, those are steel-tipped boots, said Ford. There was a sharp, ringing rap on the door. Then who is it? said Arthur. Well, said Ford, if we're lucky, it's just the Vogons come to throw us into space. And if we're unlucky? If we're unlucky, said Ford grimly, the Captain might be serious in his threat. That is going to read us some of his poetry first.
 Chapter 12 A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the heart of Gold Cabin, as Zaford searched the sub-ether radio wave-bands for news of himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials. Then, as the technology became more sophisticated, the controls were made touch-sensitive. You merely had to brush the panels with your fingers. Now all you had to do was wave your hands in the general direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular expenditure, of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme. Zaford waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk music, but this time it was a background to a news announcement. The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music. "'And News Reports brought to you here on the sub-ether wave-band, broadcasting around the galaxy around the clock,' squawked a voice, "'and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life-forms everywhere, and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys!' And of course the big news story tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President Zaford Beeblebrox. And the question everyone's asking is, has the big Z finally flipped? Beeblebrox, the man who invented the pan-galactic gargle blaster, ex-confidence trickster once described by Eccentrica Golumbitz as the best bang since the big one, and recently voted the worst-dressed sentient being in the known universe for the seventh time. Has he got an answer this time? We asked his private brain-care specialist, Gag Halfront." The music swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke in, presumably Halfront. He said, "'Well, Zaford's just his guy, you know?' but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radio's on-off-sensitive airspace. Zaford turned and glared at Trillian. She had thrown the pencil. "'Hey,' he said, "'what'd you do that for?' Trillian was tapping her finger on a screen full of figures. "'I've just thought of something,' she said. "'Oh, yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?' You hear enough about yourself as it is. "'I'm very insecure. We know that. Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important. If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.' Zaford glared at her again, then laughed. "'Listen,' she said, "'we'd picked up those couple of guys.' "'What couple of guys?' "'The couple of guys we picked up.' "'Oh, yeah,' said Zaford, "'those couple of guys.' "'We picked them up in Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.' "'Yeah?' said Zaford, and blinked. Trillian said quietly, "'Does that mean anything to you?' "'H'm,' said Zaford, "'ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.' "'Well?' said Trillian. "'Er, what does the Z mean?' said Zaford. "'Which one?' "'Any one.' One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaford was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever, and quite clearly was so, but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the act. He preferred people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous. This, above all, appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it. She sighed and punched up a star map on the Visi-screen, so she could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way. There she pointed, right there. "'Hey!' "'Yeah,' said Zaford. "'Well?' she said. "'Well what?' Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the inside of her head. She said, very calmly, "'It's the same sector you originally picked me up in.' He looked at her, and then looked back at the screen. "'Hey, yeah,' he said. "'Now that is wild. We should have zapped straight into the middle of the Horset Nebula. How did we come to be there? I mean, that's nowhere!' She ignored this. "'Improbability drive,' she said patiently. "'You explained it to me yourself. We pass through every point in the universe. You know that.' "'Yeah, but that's just one wild coincidence, isn't it?' "'Yes.' "'Picking someone up at that point, out of the whole universe to choose from? That's just too—' "'I want to work this out. Computer!' The Sirius Cybernetics shipboard computer, which controlled and permeated every particle of the ship, switched into communication mode. "'Hi there!' it said brightly, and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of ticker tape just for the record. The ticker tape said, "'Hi there!' "'Oh God!' said Zaford. He hadn't worked with this computer for long, but had already learned to loathe it. The computer continued, brash and cheery, as if it was selling detergent. "'I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help you solve it.' "'Yeah, yeah,' said Zaford. "'Look, I think I'll just use a piece of paper.' "'A sure thing,' said the computer, spilling out its message into a waste bin at the same time. "'I understand. If you ever want—' "'Shut up!' said Zaford, and snatching up a pencil, sat down next to Trillian at the console. "'Okay, okay,' said the computer in a hurt tone of voice, and closed down its speech channel again. Zaford and Trillian poured over the figures that the Improbability Flight Path scanner flashed silently up in front of them. "'Can we work out,' said Zaford, "'from their point of view what the improbability of their rescue was?' "'Yes, that's a constant,' said Trillian. "'Two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand, seven hundred and nine to one against.' "'Wah! That's high! They're two lucky, lucky guys!' "'Yes.' "'But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up—' Trillian punched up the figures. They showed two to the power of infinity minus one to one against, an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in improbability physics. "'It's pretty low,' continued Zaford with a slight whistle. "'Yes,' agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically. "'That's one big whack of improbability to be accounted for. "'I mean, something pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance sheet "'if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum.' "'Zaford scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the pencil away. "'Bats, dooz! I can't work it out.' "'Well?' "'Zaford knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth. "'Okay,' he said. "'Computer!' "'The voice circuit sprang to life again. "'Why, hello there!' they said, ticker-tape, ticker-tape. "'All I want to do is to make your day nicer and nicer and nicer—' "'Well, shut up and work something out for me.' "'Sure thing,' chatted the computer. "'You want a probability forecast based on improbability data?' "'Yeah,' said Zaford. "'Okay,' the computer continued. "'Here's an interesting little notion. "'Did you realise that most people's lives are governed by telephone numbers?' "'A pained look crawled across one of Zaford's faces and on to the other one. "'Have you flipped?' he said. "'No, but you will when I tell you that—' Trillian gasped. "'She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability Flight Path screen. "'Telephone number,' she said. "'Did that thing say telephone number?' "'Numbers flashed up on the screen.' "'The computer had paused politely, but now it continued. "'What I was about to say was that—' "'Don't bother, please,' said Trillian. "'Look, what is this?' said Zaford. "'I don't know,' said Trillian. "'But those aliens—' "'They're on the way up to the bridge with that wretched robot. "'Can we pick them up on any monitor-cameras?'
 24. Silently the air-car coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathian night. It spared swiftly. Arthur's companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in conversation again, he would simply reply by asking if he was comfortable enough, and then leave it at that. Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the blackness outside was absolute, and he was denied any reference points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight that he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all. Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance, and within seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realised it was travelling towards them at colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be. He peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the air-car dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be a collision course. Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over. The next thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him. He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realise what had happened. They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel. The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were shooting, rapidly at several hundred miles an hour. He closed his eyes in terror. After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a slight subsidence in their speed, and some while later became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt. He opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel, threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a criss-cross warren of converging tunnels. When they finally stopped, it was in a small chamber of curved steel. Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim, irritating light. It was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes. It was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far it was. Arthur guessed, quite wrongly, that it might be ultraviolet. Betty Bartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes. "'Earth-man,' he said, "'we are now deep in the heart of Magrathir.' "'How did you know I was an earthman?' demanded Arthur. "'These things will become clear to you,' said the old man gently. "'At least,' he added, with a slight doubt in his voice, "'clearer than they are at the moment.' "'I should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not literally exist within our planet. It is a little too—er—large. We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace. It may disturb you.' Arthur made nervous noises. Slarty Bartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly, "'It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight.' The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like. It wasn't infinity, in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity. Distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless. The chamber into which the air-car emerged was anything but infinite. It was just very, very, very big—so big that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself. Arthur's senses bobbed and spun. As, travelling at the immense speed he knew the air-car attained, they climbed slowly through the open air, leaving the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them. The wall. The wall defied the imagination, seduced it and defeated it. The wall was so paralyzingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond the reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man. The wall appeared perfectly flat. It would take the finest laser-measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved. It met itself again thirteen light-seconds away. In other words, the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across, and flooded with unimaginable light. Welcome, said Slartibart fast, as the tiny speck that was the air-car, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mind-boggling space. Welcome, he said, to our factory floor. Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror, ranged away before them at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, where a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light, hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space. This, said Slartibart fast, is where we make most of our planets, you see. You mean, said Arthur, trying to form the words, you mean you're starting it all up again now? No, no, good heavens, no, exclaimed the old man. No, the galaxy isn't nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we've been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very special clients from another dimension. It may interest you, there in the distance in front of us.' Arthur followed the old man's finger till he was able to pick out the floating structure he was pointing at. It was, indeed, the only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this is more a subliminal impression than anything one could put one's finger on. At that moment, however, a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within, patterns that Arthur knew, rough, blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of words part of the furniture of his mind. For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense. Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented, whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction. The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt. The earth! whispered Arthur. Well, the earth mark too, in fact, said Slartibart fast cheerfully. We're making a copy from our original blueprints. There was a pause. Are you trying to tell me, said Arthur slowly and with control, that you originally made the earth? Oh, yes, said Slartibart fast. Did you ever go to a place? I think it was called Norway. No, said Arthur. No, I didn't. Pity, said Slartibart fast. That was one of mine. Won an award, you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear of its destruction. You were upset, said Arthur. Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn't have mattered so much. It was quite a shocking cock-up. Huh? said Arthur. The mice were furious. The mice were furious? Oh, yes, said the old man mildly. Yes, well, so I expect with the dogs and cats and duck-billed platypuses. But—ah, but they hadn't paid for it, you see, had they? Look, said Arthur, would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now? For a while the air-car flew on in an awkward silence. Then the old man tried patiently to explain. Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got to build another one. Only one word was registering with Arthur. Mice, he said. Indeed, Earthman. Look, sorry, are we talking about the little white furry things with the cheese-fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early Sixties sitcoms? Slartibartfast coughed politely. Earthman, he said, it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech. Remember, I have been asleep inside this planet of Magrathir for five million years, and know little of these early Sixties sitcoms of which you speak. These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear. They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast, hyper-intelligent, pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front. The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued. They've been experimenting on you, I'm afraid. Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared. Ah, no, he said, I see the source of the misunderstanding now. Now look, you see, what happened was that we used to do experiments on them. They were often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuff. So what happened was that the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run round mazes and things, so that the whole nature of the learning process could be examined. From our observations of their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about our own. Arthur's voice tailed off. Such subtlety, said Slutty Bartfast, one has to admire it. What? said Arthur. How better to disguise their real natures! How better to guide your thinking! Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis! If it's finely calculated, the cumulative effect is enormous. He paused for effect. You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings. Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten-million-year research programme. Let me tell you the whole story. It'll take a little time.' Time, said Arthur weakly, is not currently one of my problems.
 Chapter 25. There are, of course, many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are, Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches? Many, many millions of years ago, a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings, whose physical manifestation in their own pan-dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own, got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life, which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockean Ultra Cricket, a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away, that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all. And to this end, they built themselves a stupendous supercomputer, which was so amazingly intelligent that even before its data banks had been connected up, it had started from, I think, therefore I am, and got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off. It was the size of a small city. Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest ultra-mahogany topped with rich ultra-red leather. The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous. Exotic pot-plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square. On the day of the great on-turning, two soberly dressed programmers with briefcases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office. They were aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the desk, opened their briefcases, and took out their leather-bound notebooks. Their names were Lunkwill and Fook. For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black panel. The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich, resonant, and deep. It said, What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the universe of time and space, have been called into existence? Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise. Your task, O Computer, began Fook. No, no, no, wait a minute. This isn't right, said Lunkwill, worried. We distinctly design this computer to be the greatest one ever. We're not making do with second best. Deep Thought, he addressed the computer, are you not, as we designed you to be, the greatest, most powerful computer in all time? I described myself as the second greatest, intoned Deep Thought, and such I am. Another worried look passed between the two programmers. Lunkwill cleared his throat. There must be some mistake, he said. Are you not a greater computer than the milliard gargantubrain at Maximegalon, which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond? A milliard gargantubrain? said Deep Thought, with unconcealed contempt. A mere abacus! Mention it not. And are you not, said Fook, leaning anxiously forward, a greater analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the seventh galaxy of light and ingenuity, which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five-week dangrabad beta sand blizzard? A five-week sand blizzard? said Deep Thought, haughtily. You ask this of me, who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff! The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. Then Lunkwill leaned forward again. But are you not, he said, a more fiendish disputant than the great hyperlobic omnicognate neutron wrangler of Ciceronicus Twelve, the magic and indefatigable? The great hyperlobic omnicognate neutron wrangler, said Deep Thought, thoroughly rolling the R's, could talk all four legs off an Arcturian megadonkey, but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards. Then what, said Fook, is the problem? There is no problem, said Deep Thought, with magnificent ringing tones. I am simply the second greatest computer in the universe of space and time. But the second, insisted Lunkwill. Why do you keep saying the second? You're surely not thinking of the multi-corticoid perspicutron Titan-muller, are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the— The two contemptuous lights flashed across the computer's console. I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons, he boomed. I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me. Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and muttered—I think this is getting needlessly messianic— You know nothing of future time, pronounced Deep Thought, and yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta-streams of future probability, and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate, eventually, to design. Fook sighed heavily and glanced across at Lunkwill. Can we get on and ask the question? he said. Lunkwill motioned him to wait. What computer is this of which you speak? he asked. I will speak of it no further in this present time, said Deep Thought. Now ask what else of me you will that I may function. Speak. They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself. O Deep Thought Computer, he said, the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us—he paused—the answer. The answer? said Deep Thought. The answer to what? Life! urged Fook. The universe! said Lunkwill. Living! there said in chorus. Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection. Tricky! he said finally. But can you do it? Again a significant pause. Yes! said Deep Thought. I can do it. There is an answer? said Fook with breathless excitement. A simple answer? added Lunkwill. Yes! said Deep Thought. Life, the universe, and everything! There is an answer. But, he added, I'll have to think about it. A second commotion destroyed the moment. The door flew open and two angry men, wearing the coarse-faded blue robes and belts of the Crux One University, burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way. We demand admission! shouted the younger of the two men, elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat. Come on! shouted the older one. You can't keep us out! He pushed a junior programmer back through the door. We demand that you can't keep us out! bawled the younger one, though he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made to stop him. Who are you? said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. What do you want? I am Magic Thighs! announced the older one. And I demand that I am Vroomfondle! shouted the younger one. Magic Thighs turned on Vroomfondle. It's all right! he explained angrily. You don't need to demand that. All right! bawled Vroomfondle, banging on a nearby desk. I am Vroomfondle, and that is not a demand. That is a solid fact. What we demand is solid facts! No, we don't! exclaimed Magic Thighs in irritation. That is precisely what we don't demand. Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondle shouted, We don't demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid facts! I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondle! But who the devil are you? exclaimed an outraged Fook. We, said Magic Thighs, are philosophers! Though we may not be, said Vroomfondle, waving a warning finger at the programmers. Yes, we are, insisted Magic Thighs. We are quite definitely here as representatives of the amalgamated union of philosophers, sages, luminaries and other thinking persons, and we want this machine off, and we want it off now! What's the problem? said Lunkwill. I'll tell you what the problem is, mate, said Magic Thighs. Demarcation, that's the problem! We demand, yelled Vroomfondle, that demarcation may or may not be the problem! You just let the machines get on with the adding up, warned Magic Thighs, and we'll take care of the eternal verities, thank you very much. You want to check your legal position, you do, mate. Under law, the quest for ultimate truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Any bloody machine goes and actually finds it, and we're straight out of a job, aren't we? I mean, what's the use of us sitting up half the night arguing that there may or may not be a god, if this machine only goes and gives you his bleeding phone number the next morning? That's right, shouted Vroomfondle. We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty! Suddenly, a stentorian voice boomed across the room. Might I make an observation at this point? inquired Deep Thought. Well, go on, strike! yelled Vroomfondle. That's right, agreed Magic Thighs. You'll have a national philosopher's strike on your hands! The hum level in the room suddenly increased to several ancillary bass-driver units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give Deep Thought's voice a little more power. All I wanted to say, bellowed the computer, is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. He paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone's attention, before continuing more quietly. But the programme will take me a little while to run. Fouke glanced impatiently at his watch. How long? he said. Seven and a half million years, said Deep Thought. Lunkwell and Fouke blinked at each other. Seven and a half million years? they cried in chorus. Yes, declaimed Deep Thought. I said I'd have to think about it, didn't I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone's going to have their own theories about what answer I'm eventually going to come up with, and who better to capitalise on that media market than you yourselves, so long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular press, and so long as you have clever agents, you can keep yourselves on the gravy train for life. How does that sound? The two philosophers gaped at him. Bloody hell, said Magic Thighs. Now that is what I call thinking. Here, Vroom Fondle, why do we never think of things like that? Dunno, said Vroom Fondle in an awed whisper. Think our brains must be too highly trained, Magic Thighs. So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams.
 Chapter 9. A computer chattered to itself an alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason. This was because reason was in fact out to lunch. A hole had just appeared in the galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of millions of light-years from end to end. As it closed up, lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe. A team of seven three-foot-high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxiation and partly of surprise. Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too, materialising in a large wobbly heap on the famine-struck land of Pogril in the Pansel system. The whole Pogril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later. The nothingth of a second for which the whole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion. Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatised a small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves. This was part of what was so extraordinary about the patterns, and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to. That was how life began in the universe. Five wild event-milestroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed up a pavement. On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, gulping like half-spent fish. There you are, gasped Ford, scrabbling for a finger-hold on the pavement as it raced through the third reach of the unknown. I told you I'd think of something. Oh, sure, said Arthur, sure. Bright idea of mine, said Ford, to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it. The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various pretend ones flitted silently by like mountain goats. Primal light exploded, splattering space-time with gobbets of junket. Time blossomed, matter shrank away, the highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever. Oh, come off it, said Arthur. The chances against it were astronomical. Don't knock it. It worked, said Ford. What sort of ship are we in? asked Arthur, as the pit of eternity yawned beneath them. I don't know, said Ford. I haven't opened my eyes yet. No, nor have I, said Arthur. The universe jumped, froze, quivered, and splayed out in several unexpected directions. Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise. Good God, said Arthur, it looks just like the sea-front at South End. How I'm relieved to hear you say that, said Ford. Why? Because I thought I must be going mad. Well, perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it. Ford thought about this. Well, did you say it or didn't you? he asked. I think so, said Arthur. Well, perhaps we're both going mad. Yes, said Arthur. We'd be mad, all things considered, to think this was South End. Well, do you think it's South End? Oh, yes. So do I. Therefore we must be mad. Nice day for it. Yes, said a passing maniac. Who's that? asked Arthur. Who? The man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers. Yes. I don't know. Just someone. Ah. They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses thundered through the sky, taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the uncertain areas. You know, said Arthur, with a slight cough, if this is South End, there's something very odd about it. You mean the way the sea stays steady as a rock and the buildings keep washing up and down, said Ford? Yes, I thought that was odd too. In fact, he continued, as with a huge bang, South End split itself into six equal segments which danced and spun giddily around each other in lewd and licentious formations, there is something altogether very strange going on. Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot doughnuts popped out of the road for tenpence each, horrid fish stormed out of the sky, and Ford and Arthur decided to make a run for it. They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats, and suddenly heard a girl's voice. It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling, and that was all. Ford skidded down a beam of light and spun round, trying to find a source for the voice, but could see nothing he could seriously believe in. What was that voice? shouted Arthur. I don't know, yelled Ford, I don't know, it sounded like a measurement of probability. Probability? What do you mean? Probability, you know, like two to one, three to one, five to four against. It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against. That's pretty improbable, you know. A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning. But what does it mean? cried Arthur. What, the custard? No, no, no, the measurement of improbability. I don't know, I don't know at all. I think we're on some kind of spaceship. I can only assume, said Arthur, that this is not the first-class compartment. Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time, great ugly bulges. Arrrrrgh! said Arthur, as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions. South End seems to be melting away. The stars are swirling. A dust-bowl. My legs are drifting off into the sunset. My left arm's come off too. A frightening thought struck him. Hallie said, how am I going to operate my digital watch now? He wound his eyes desperately round in Ford's direction. Ford, he said, you're turning into a penguin. Stop it. Again came the voice. Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and falling. Ford waddled round his pond in a furious circle. Hey, who are you? he quacked. Where are you? What's going on and is there any way of stopping it? Please relax, said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines, one of which is on fire. You are perfectly safe. But that's not the point, raged Ford. The point is that I am now a perfectly safe penguin and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs. It's all right. I've got them back now, said Arthur. Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling, said the voice. Admittedly, said Arthur, they're longer than I usually like them. But isn't there anything, squawked Ford in avian fury, you feel you ought to be telling us? The voice cleared its throat. A giant putty-four lolloped off into the distance. Welcome, the voice said, to the starship Heart of Gold. The voice continued. Please do not be alarmed, it said, by anything you see or hear around you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against, possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of twenty thousand to one against and falling. The voice cut out. Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle. Ford was wildly excited. Arthur, he said, this is fantastic. We've been picked up by a ship powered by the infinite improbability drive. This is incredible. I heard rumours about it before. They were all officially denied, but they must have done it. They've built the improbability drive. Arthur, this is—Arthur, what's happening? Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying to hold it closed, but it was ill-fitting. Tiny, furry little hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks. Their fingers were ink-stained. Tiny voices chattered insanely. Arthur looked up. Ford, he said, there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about the script for Hamlet they've worked out.
 Chapter 10 The infinite improbability drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's research team on Damogran. This briefly is the story of its discovery. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambolwini 57 submeson brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, was of course well understood, and such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy. Many respectable physicists said they weren't going to stand for this sort of thing, partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties. Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mind-paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible. Then one day a student who had been left to sweep up the lab, after a particularly unsuccessful party, found himself reasoning this way. If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability. So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea and turn it on. He did this and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long-sought-after golden infinite improbability generator out of thin air. It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's prize for extreme cleverness, he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realised that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smart-arse.
 Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small, unregarded, yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life-forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has, or rather had, a problem, which was this. Most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained. Lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place, and some said that even the trees had been a bad move and that no one should ever have left the oceans. And then one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realised what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever. This is not her story. But it is the story of that terrible, stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences. It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Not an earth book, never published on earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or even heard of by any earthman. Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book. In fact, it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor, of which no earthman had ever heard either. Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one, more popular than the Celestial Homecare omnibus, better selling than 53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolong Colufid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes, and Who is This God-Person Anyway? In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the outer eastern rim of the galaxy, The Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly, it has the words, Don't Panic! inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover. But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply. It begins with a house.
 Chapter 3. On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere, many miles above the surface of the planet. Several somethings, in fact. Several dozen huge yellow chunky slab-like somethings, huge as office blocks, silent as birds. They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goon Hilly. They passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip. Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them, which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they had been looking for all these years. The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a sub-ether sans-somatic, which winked away quietly to itself. It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel, which Ford Prefect habitually wore slung around his neck. The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel were quite interesting, in fact, and would have made any earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for, stuffed in the top. Besides the sub-ether sans-somatic and the scripts, he had an electronic thumb, a short, squat, black rod, smooth and matte, with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end. He also had a device which looked rather like a large-ish electronic calculator. This had about a hundred tiny flat press-buttons, and a screen about four inches square, on which any one of a million pages could be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked insanely complicated, and this is one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words, Don't Panic, printed on it in large, friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was, in fact, that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor—the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the form of a micro-sub-Misson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitchhiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in. Beneath that, in Ford Prefect's satchel, were a few ball-pens, a notepad, and a large-ish bath-towel from Marks and Spencer. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels. A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly, it has great practical value. You can wrap it round yourself for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta. You can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santragenes V, inhaling the heady sea vapours. You can sleep under it, beneath the stars which shine so readily on the desert world of Cacrofoon. Use it to sail a mini-raft down the slow, heavy river Moth. Wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat. Wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes. Or avoid the gaze of the ravenous bug-blatter beast of Troll, a mind-bogglingly stupid animal. It assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you. Daft as a brush, but very, very ravenous. You can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal. And, of course, dry yourself off with it, if it still seems to be clean enough. More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a stragg—stragg means non-hitchhiker—discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, spacesuit, etc., Furthermore, the stragg will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have lost. What the stragg will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with. Hence a phrase which has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in, Hey, you sass that hoopy, Ford Prefect? There's a fruid who really knows where his towel is. Sass means no, be aware of, meet, have sex with. Hoopy means really to gather guy. Fruid means really amazingly to gather guy. Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel, the sub-ether sensomatic began to wink more quickly. Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At Jodrell Bank someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea. You got a towel with you? said Ford suddenly to Arthur. Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him. Why? What? No. Should I have? He had given up being surprised. There didn't seem to be any point any longer. Ford clicked his tongue in irritation. Drink up! he urged. At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccuping over the whisky Ford had eventually bought him. Arthur choked on his beer and leapt to his feet. What's that? he yelped. Don't worry, said Ford. They haven't started yet. Thank God for that, said Arthur, and relaxed. It's probably just your house being knocked down, said Ford, downing his last pint. What? shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford's spell was broken. Arthur looked wildly round him and ran to the window. My God, they are! They're knocking my house down. What the hell am I doing in the pub, Ford? It hardly makes any difference at this stage, said Ford. Let them have their fun. Fun? yelped Arthur. Fun? He quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the same thing. Damn their fun! he hooted, and ran out of the pub, furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass. He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime. Stop, you vandals, you homewreckers! bawled Arthur. You half-grazed busy gods, stop, will you? Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman, he asked for four packets of peanuts. There you are, sir, said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar. It's one pound sixty pence if you'd be so kind. Ford was very kind. He gave the barman another ten-pound note and told him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford. He suddenly shivered. He experienced a momentary sensation that he didn't understand, because no one on earth had ever experienced it before. In moments of great stress, every life-form that exists gives out a tiny subliminal signal. This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth. On earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which isn't really very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born six hundred light-years away in the near vicinity of Beetlejuice. The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking incomprehensible sense of distance. He didn't know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe. Are you serious, sir? he said in a small whisper, which had the effect of silencing the pub. You think the world's going to end? Yes, said Ford. But this afternoon— Ford had recovered himself. He was at his flippest. Yes, he said gaily, in less than two minutes, I would estimate. The barman couldn't believe this conversation he was having, but he couldn't believe the sensation he had just had, either. Isn't there anything we can do about it, then? he said. Nope, nothing, said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pocket. Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become. The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes weaved their way up to Ford. I thought, he said, that if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something. If you like, yes, said Ford. That's what they told us in the Army, said the man, and his eyes began the long trek back towards his whisky. Will that help? asked the barman. No, said Ford, and gave him a friendly smile. Excuse me, said I've got to go. With a wave he left. The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone, and carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it. The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say, Last orders, please. The huge yellow machines began to sink downwards and to move faster. Ford knew they were there. This wasn't the way he had wanted it. Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He didn't notice how cold it had suddenly become. He didn't notice the wind. He didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain. He didn't notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home. You barbarians! he yelled. I'll sue the council for every penny it's got. I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered and whipped and boiled until you've had enough. Ford was running after him very fast, very, very fast. And then I'll do it again! yelled Arthur. And when I've finished I will take all the bits and I will jump on them. Arthur didn't notice that the men were running from the bulldozers. He didn't notice that Mr. Prosser was staring hectically into the sky. What Mr. Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings. And I will carry on jumping on them, yelled Arthur, still running, until I get blisters or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do. And then... Arthur tripped and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back. At last he noticed that something was going on. His finger shot upwards. What the hell's that? he shrieked. Whatever it was raced across the sky in its monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with mind-buggering noise, and leapt off into the distance, leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your skull. Another one followed and did exactly the same thing, only louder. It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what they were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense. Running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise. All around the world, city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them, and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit. Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly what was happening, and had known ever since his sabitha sensomatic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillow and woken him with a start. It was what he had waited for all these years. But when he had deciphered the signal pattern, sitting alone in his small, dark room, a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart. Of all the races in all of the galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the Vogons? Still, he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him, he opened his satchel. He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He threw away a copy of Godspell. He wouldn't need them where he was going. Everything was ready. Everything was prepared. He knew where his towel was. A sudden silence hit the earth. If anything, it was worse than the noise. For a while, nothing happened. The great ships hung motionless in the sky over every nation on earth. Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at, as ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't. And still nothing happened. Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden, spacious whisper of open, ambient sound. Every hi-fi set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid-range driver in the world, quietly turned itself on. Every tin can, every dustbin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board. Before the earth passed away, it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message. People of earth, your attention, please, a voice said. And it was wonderful. Wonderful, perfect, quadraphonic sound, distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep. This is Prostatnik Vogonjeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, the voice continued. As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system. And regrettably, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your earth minutes. Thank you. The PA died away. Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of earth. The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron filings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic. But there was nowhere to flee to. Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said, There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it now. The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land. The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On the underside of each, a hatchway opened, an empty black square. By this time, somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcast a message back to the Vogon ships to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever heard what they said. They only heard the reply. The PA slammed back into life again. The voice was annoyed. It said, What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven's sake, mankind, it's only four light years away, you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs, that's your own lookout. Energise the demolition beams. Light poured out of the hatchways. I don't know, said the voice on the PA, apathetic bloody planet and no sympathy at all. It cut off. There was a terrible ghastly silence. There was a terrible ghastly noise. There was a terrible ghastly silence. The Vogon Constructor Fleet coasted away into the inky, starry void.
 Chapter 2. Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It says that alcohol is a colorless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars, and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon-based life forms. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says that the best drink in existence is the pangalactic gargle blaster. It says that the effect of drinking a pangalactic gargle blaster is like having your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick. The Guide also tells you on which planets the best pangalactic gargle blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one, and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards. The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself. Take the juice from one bottle of that old jank spirit, it says. Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V. Oh, that Santraginian seawater, it says. Oh, those Santraginian fish. Allow three cubes of Arcturian megagen to melt into the mixture. It must be properly iced or the benzene is lost. Allow four liters of Thalian marsh gas to bubble through it. In memory of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the marshes of failure. Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of qualactin hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odors of the dark qualactin zones, subtle, sweet, and mystic. Drop in the tooth of an Algolian sun tiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian suns deep into the heart of the drink. Sprinkle Zamphour. Add an olive. Drink, but very carefully. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia Galactica. Six pints of bitter, said Ford Prefect to the barman of the horse and groom, and quickly, please, the world's about to end. The barman of the horse and groom didn't deserve this sort of treatment. He was a dignified old man. He pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared out of the window. Sir the barman looked instead at Arthur, who shrugged helplessly and said nothing. Sir the barman said, Oh, yes, sir, nice weather for it, and started pulling pints. He tried again. Can I watch the match this afternoon, then? Ford glanced round at him. No, no point, he said, and looked back out of the window. Well, sir, a foregone conclusion, then, you reckon, sir? said the barman. Arsenal without a chance? No, no, said Ford, it's just that the world's about to end. Oh, yes, sir, so you said, said the barman, looking over his glasses this time at Arthur. Like he escaped for Arsenal if it did. Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised. No, not really, he said. He frowned. The barman breathed in heavily. There you are, sir, six pints, he said. Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and smiled wanly at the rest of the pub, just in case any of them had heard what was going on. None of them had, and none of them could understand what he was smiling at them for. A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked, and grinned a stupid, hopeful grin at them. Get off, said Ford, they're ours, giving him a look that would have made an Algolian sun-tiger get on with what it was doing. Ford slapped a ten-pound note on the bar. He said, keep the change. What, from a tenner? Thank you, sir. You've got ten minutes left to spend it. The barman decided simply to walk away for a bit. Ford, said Arthur, would you please tell me what the hell is going on? Drink up, said Ford, you've got three pints to get through. Three pints, said Arthur, at lunch-time? The man next to Ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored him. He said, time is an illusion, lunch-time doubly so. Oh, very deep, said Arthur. You should send that in to the Reader's Digest. They've got a page for people like you. Drink up. Why three pints all of a sudden? Muscle relaxant. You'll need it. Muscle relaxant. Muscle relaxant. Arthur stared into his beer. Did I do anything wrong today? he said. Or has the world always been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice? All right, said Ford, I'll try to explain. Now, how long have we known each other? How long? Arthur thought. About five years, maybe six. Most of it seemed to make some kind of sense at the time. All right, said Ford. How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Beetlejuice? Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way. I don't know, he said, taking a pull of beer. Why, do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to say? Ford gave up. It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment what with the world being about to end. He just said, drink up. He added, perfectly factually, the world's about to end. Arthur gave the rest of the pub another one smile. The rest of the pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business. This must be Thursday, said Arthur to himself, sinking low over his beer. I never could get the hang of Thursdays.
 Chapter 15. Excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, page 634784, section 5A, entry, MAGRATHEA Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich, and largely tax-free. Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of galactic space. In those days, spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before, and thus was the Empire forged. Many men, of course, became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of, because no one was really poor, at least no one worth speaking of. And for all the richest and most successful merchants, life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the worlds they had settled on. None of them was entirely satisfactory. Either the climate wasn't quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink. And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry, custom-made luxury planet-building. The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets, gold planets, platinum planets, and softer rubber planets with lots of earthquakes, all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the galaxy's richest men naturally came to expect. But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the richest planet of all time, and the rest of the galaxy was reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion hungry worlds, disturbed only by the pen-scratchings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treatises on the value of a planned political economy. Magrathea itself disappeared, and its memory soon passed into the obscurity of legend. In these enlightened days, of course, no one believes a word of it.
 Chapter 4 Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the galaxy, five hundred thousand light-years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion-drive delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun. Damogran the Hot, Damogran the Remote, Damogran the almost totally unheard of, Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold. The boat sped on across the water. It will be some time before it reaches its destination, because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet. It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean. The boat sped on. Because of this topographical awkwardness, Damogran has always remained a deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted, and the Heart of Gold project was so secret. The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island. The name was an entirely meaningless coincidence. In galactic speak, Easter means small, flat, and light brown. To the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France. One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of petty, meaningless coincidences. But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent shock-waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy. Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not THE Zaphod Beeblebrox? I mean, not THE President? Many had seen it as clenching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas. Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed. Zaphod Beeblebrox? Adventurer, ex-hippie, good-timer, crook, quite possibly, manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch. President? The full title is President of the Imperial Galactic Government. The term Imperial is kept, though it is now an anachronism. The hereditary Emperor is nearly dead, and has been for many centuries. In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in a stasis-field which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without any drastic political upheaval, power has simply and effectively moved a rung or two down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act simply as advisers to the Emperor, an elected government assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly. In fact, it vests in no such place. The President in particular is very much a figurehead. He wields no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the Government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership, but of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power, but to draw attention away from it. On those criteria, Seyfard Biblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had. He has already spent two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very, very few people realise that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of these few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a computer. They couldn't be more wrong. No, no one had gone bananas—not in that way at least. Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Seyfard Biblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli. He was ideal Presidency fodder. What they completely failed to understand was why Seyfard was doing it. He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun. Today was the day. Today was the day when they would realise what Seyfard had been up to. Today was what Seyfard Biblebrox's Presidency was all about. Today was also his 200th birthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence. As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a wonderful, exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily along the seat-back. He steered with an extra arm he'd recently outfitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing. "'Hey,' he cooed to himself, "'you're a real cool boy, you!' But his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog-whistle." The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across the middle, sandy and crescent-shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right, as simply a means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay. This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs. From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the opposite shore. On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee. It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold, mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green sylph-like maximegalitians, an octopodic physactralist or two, and a huluvoo. A huluvoo is a super-intelligent shade of the colour blue. All except the huluvoo were resplendent in their multicoloured ceremonial lab-coats. The huluvoo had been temporarily refracted into a freestanding prison for the occasion. There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through them all. Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted, and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck. An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore. It might not even have made much difference to them if they had known exactly how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded. None at all. Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power, but to attract attention away from it. Zephod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job. The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seamanship, as the Presidential Speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide, skidding turns. In fact, it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionised atoms, but just for effect it was fitted with thin, thin blades which could be lowered into the water. They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes in the sea, which swayed crazily and sank back foaming in the boat's wake as it careered across the bay. Zephod loved effect. It was what he was best at. He twisted the wheel sharply. The boat slewed round in a wild, scything skid beneath the cliff face, and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves. Within seconds he was out onto the deck, and waved and grinned at over three billion people. The three billion people weren't actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri-D. That's what they were for. He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn't know it, but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for. The robot camera moved in for a close-up on the more popular of his two heads, and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in appearance, except for the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost always unshaven. A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it floated a wide semi-circular sofa, upholstered in glorious red leather. The more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all done for effect, as much as anything. Zafod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa. He spread his two arms along the back, and with the third brushed some dust off his knee. His head looked about, smiling. He put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might scream. Water boiled up beneath the bubble. It seethed and spouted. The bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water-spout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff. Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below. Zafod smiled, picturing himself. A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one. At the top of the cliff, the globe wavered for a moment, tipped onto a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform, and riddled to a halt. To tremendous applause, Zafod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light. The President of the Galaxy had arrived. He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hand in greeting. Hi, he said. A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven of the original version were at that moment floating soggily on the Damagran Sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damagran frond-crested eagle, and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of papier-mâché, and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it. The Damagran frond-crested eagle had heard of the notion of the survival of the species, but wanted no truck with it. Zafod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech, and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider. Hi, he said again. One beamed at him, or at least nearly every one. He singled out Trillion from the crowd. Trillion was a girl that Zafod had picked up recently while visiting a planet just for fun incognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little knob of a nose, and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head-scarf knotted in that particular way, and her long, flowing, silky-brown dress, she looked vaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab, of course. The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light-years from Damagran. Trillion wasn't anybody in particular, or so Zafod claimed. She just went around with him rather a lot, and told him what she thought of him. Hi, honey, he said to her. She flashed him a quick, tight smile and looked away. Then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly, but by this time he was looking at something else. Hi, he said to a small lot of creatures from the press, who were standing nearby, wishing that he would stop saying hi and get on with the quotes. He grinned at them particularly, because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote. The next thing he said, though, was not of a lot of use to them. One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in the mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground. Everyone gasped, although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that, because they had built it that way. Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mind-bogglingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried within it the most brain-wrenching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named the Heart of Gold. Wow! said Seyford Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't much else he could say. He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press. Wow! The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He winked at Trillian, who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him. She knew what he was about to say, and thought him a terrible show-off. That is really amazing, he said. That really is truly amazing. That is so amazingly amazing, I think I'd like to steal it. A marvellous presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their sub-ether newsmatics, and the President grinned. As he grinned, his heart screamed unbearably, and he fingered the small paralyzomatic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket. Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground, and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen, beaming smiles.
 Chapter 22 He was standing with his back to Arthur, watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was tallish, elderly, and dressed in a single, long, grey robe. When he turned, his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with. But he didn't turn yet, not even to react to Arthur's yelp of surprise. Eventually, the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned. His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the source of the light, he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some kind, a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed. It shed a dim pool of light around it. The man looked at Arthur sadly, it seemed. You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet? he said. Who—who are you? stammered Arthur. The man looked away. Again a look of sadness seemed to cross his face. My name is not important, he said. He seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was clearly something he felt he didn't have to rush at. Arthur felt awkward. I—er—you startled me, he said, lamely. The man looked around at him again and slightly raised his eyebrows. Hm? he said. I said you startled me. Do not be alarmed. I will not harm you. Arthur frowned at him. But you shot at us. There were missiles, he said. The man gazed into the pit of the crater. The slight glow from Marvin's eyes cast very faint red shadows on the huge carcass of the whale. The man chuckled slightly. An automatic system, he said, and gave a small sigh. Ancient computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data-banks. I think they take the occasional pot-shot to relieve a monotony. He looked gravely at Arthur and said, I am a great fan of science, you know. Oh! er—really? said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man's curious, kindly manner disconcerting. Oh, yes! said the old man, and simply stopped talking again. Ah! said Arthur. Um—he had an odd feeling of being like a man in the act of adultery, who is surprised when the woman's husband wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather, and leaves again. You seem ill at ease, said the old man with polite concern. Er—no—well, yes. Well, actually, you see, we weren't really expecting to find anybody about, in fact. I sort of gathered that you were all dead or something. Dead! said the old man. Good gracious me! No, no, we have but slept. Slept! said Arthur incredulously. Yes, through the economic recession, you see, said the old man, apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he was talking about or not. Arthur had to prompt him again. Economic recession? Well, you see, five million years ago the galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-built planets are something of a luxury commodity, you see— He paused and looked at Arthur. You know we built planets, do you? he asked solemnly. Well, yes, said Arthur. I had sort of gathered. Fascinating trade! said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes. Doing the coast-lines was always my favourite. Used to have endless fun doing the little bits and fjords. So anyway, he said, trying to find his thread again, the recession came, and we decided it would save a lot of bother if we just slept through it. So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over. The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued. The computers were index-linked to the galactic stock-market prices, you see, so that we'd all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services. Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this. Well, that's a pretty unpleasant way to behave, isn't it? Is it? asked the old man mildly. I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of touch. He pointed down into the crater. Is that robot yours? he said. No, came a thin metallic voice from the crater. I'm mine. If you'd call it a robot, muttered Arthur, it's more a sort of electronic sulking machine. Bring it! said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision suddenly present in the old man's voice. He called to Marvin, who crawled up the slope, making a big show of being lame, which he wasn't. On second thoughts, said the old man, leave it here. You must come with me. Great things are afoot. He turned towards his craft, which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through the dark. Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater again, muttering sour nothings to himself. Come, called the old man. Come now, or you will be late. Late? said Arthur. What for? What is your name, human? Dent. Arthur Dent, said Arthur. Late, as in the late Dent Arthur Dent, said the old man sternly. It's a sort of threat, you see. Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes. I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can be terribly effective. Arthur blinked at him. What an extraordinary person! he muttered to himself. I beg your pardon? said the old man. Oh, nothing. I'm sorry, said Arthur in embarrassment. All right. Where do we go? In my air-car, said the old man, motioning Arthur to get into the craft, which had settled silently next to them. We are going deep into the bowels of the planet, where even now our race is being revived from its five-million-year slumber. Magrathir awakes. Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man. The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky, quite unsettled him. He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel. Excuse me, he said to him. What is your name, by the way? My name? said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again. He paused. My name, he said, is Slartibartfast. Arthur practically choked. I beg your pardon? he spluttered. Slartibartfast, repeated the old man quietly. Slartibartfast! exclaimed Arthur. The old man looked at him gravely. I said it wasn't important, he said. The air-car sailed through the night.
 Chapter XXI On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily. Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at random. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book, and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the time. One of these, the one Arthur now came across, supposedly relates the experiences of one Wiet Voetigig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics, and the wave-harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of drinking pan-galactic gargle-blasters of Zaphod Bibelbrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened to all the ball-pens or bi-ros he had bought over the past few years. There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centres of bi-ro loss throughout the galaxy, and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treoids, and super-intelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to bi-ro life-forms. And it was to this planet that unattended bi-ros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space, to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely bi-roid lifestyle, responding to highly bi-ro-orientated stimuli, and generally leading the bi-ro equivalent of the good life. And, as theories go, this was all very fine and pleasant, until Wiet Wudugig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a while, driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables. Whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which was the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public. When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Wudugig had claimed for this planet, they discovered only a small asteroid, inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying. There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Altarian dollars paid yearly into his Brandtisvoggen bank account, and, of course, Leifod Bibelbrox's highly profitable second-hand bi-ro business. Arthur read this and put the book down. The robot still sat there completely inert. Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater. He walked around the crater. He watched two suns set magnificently over Magrathir. He went back down into the crater. He worked the robot up, because even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody. "'Night's falling,' he said. "'Look, robot, the stars are coming out. From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen.' The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back. "'I know,' he said. "'Wretched, isn't it?' "'But that sunset! I've never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams. The two suns! It was like mountains of fire boiling into space!' "'I've seen it,' said Marvin. "'It's rubbish!' "'We only ever had the one sun at home,' persevered Arthur. "'I come from a planet called Earth, you know.' "'I know,' said Marvin. "'You keep going on about it. It sounds awful.' "'Oh, no! It was a beautiful place.' "'Did it have oceans?' "'Oh, yes,' said Arthur, with a sigh. "'Great, wide, rolling, blue oceans.' "'Can't bear oceans,' said Marvin. "'Tell me,' inquired Arthur, "'do you get on well with other robots?' "'Hate them,' said Marvin. "'Where are you going?' Arthur couldn't bear any more. He had got up again. "'I think I'll just take another walk,' he said. "'Don't blame you,' said Marvin, and counted five hundred and ninety-seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later. Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job. He trudged back up the wall of the crater. Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark. Because of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed him.'
 23. It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet earth man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars, and so on, whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons. Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for titbits, so they eventually gave up and left the earth by their own means, shortly before the Vogons arrived. The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the Star Spangled Banner, but in fact the message was this, So long, and thanks for all the fish. In fact, there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running around inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man. The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these creatures' plans.
 32. EMERGENCY! EMERGENCY! blared the klaxons throughout Magrathir. HOSTILE SHIP HAS LANDED ON PLANET! ARMED INTRUDERS IN SECTION 8A! DEFENCE STATIONS! DEFENCE STATIONS! The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass transports, where they lay shattered on the floor. Damnation! muttered Frankie Mouse. All that fuss over two pounds of earthling brain. He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static. The only thing we can do now, said Benjy, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, is to try and fake a question, invent one that'll sound plausible. Difficult, said Frankie. He thought. How about, what's yellow and dangerous? Benjy considered this for a moment. No, no good, he said. Doesn't fit the answer. He sank into silence for a few seconds. All right, said Benjy. What do you get if you multiply six by seven? No, no, too literal, too factual, said Frankie. Wouldn't sustain the punter's interest. Again they thought. Then Frankie said, Here's a thought. How many roads must a man walk down? Ah, said Benjy. Ah, now that does sound promising. He rolled the phrase around a little. Yes, he said. That's excellent. Sounds very significant, without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty-two. Excellent, excellent. That'll fox him. Frankie baby, we are made. They performed a scampering dance in their excitement. Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards. Half a mile away four figures pounded up a corridor, looking for a way out. They emerged into a wide, open-plan computer bay. They glanced about wildly. Which way, you reckon, Zafod? said Ford. At a wild guess I'd say down here, said Zafod, running off down to the right between a computer bank and the wall. As the others started after him he was brought up short by a killer-zap energy bolt that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall. A voice on a loud hailer said, OK, Beeblebrox, hold it right there, we've got you covered. Cops, hissed Zafod and spun round on a crouch. You want to try a guess at all, Ford? OK, this way, said Ford, and the four of them run down a gangway between two computer banks. At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space-suited figure, waving a vicious killer-zap gun. We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox, shouted the figure. It's me fine, shouted Zafod back, and dived down a wide gap between two data-process units. The others swerved in behind him. There are two of them, said Trillian. We're cornered. They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall. They held their breath and waited. Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously. Hey, they're shooting at us, said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball. I thought they said they didn't want to do that. Yeah, I thought they said that, agreed Ford. Zafod stuck her head up for a dangerous moment. Hey, he said, I thought you said you didn't want to shoot us, and ducked again. They waited. After a moment a voice replied, saying, It isn't easy being a cop. What did he say, whispered Ford in astonishment. He said it isn't easy being a cop, said Zafod. Well, surely that's his problem, isn't it? I'd have thought so, Ford shouted out. Hey, listen, I think we've got enough problems of our own having you shooting at us. So if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it easier to cope. Another pause, and then the loud hailer again. Now see here, guy, said the voice on the loud hailer. You're not dealing with any dumb two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes, and no conversation. We're a couple of intelligent, caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you met us socially. I don't go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy Space Rangers bars, like some cops I could mention. No, I go around shooting people gratuitously, and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend. And I write novels, chimed in the other cop, though I haven't had any of them published yet, so I'd better warn you, I'm in a mean mood. Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. Who are these guys? he said. Dunno, said Zaphod. I think I preferred it when they were shooting. So are you gonna come quietly, shouted one of the cops again. Or are you gonna let us blast you out? Which would you prefer? shouted Ford. A millisecond later, the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after bolt of killer Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them. The fusillade continued for several seconds at an unbearable intensity. When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near-quietness as the echoes died away. You still there? called one of the cops. Yes, they called back. We didn't enjoy doing that at all, shouted the other cop. We could tell, shouted Ford. Now listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good. Why? shouted back Zaphod. Because, shouted the cop, it's gonna be very intelligent and quite interesting and humane. Now, either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course, because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we notice on our way out here. But that's crazy, cried Trillian. You wouldn't do that? Oh yes, we would, shouted the cop. Wouldn't we? he asked the other one. Oh yeah, we'd have to, no question. The other one yelled back. But why? demanded Trillian. Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and everything. I just don't believe these guys, muttered Ford, shaking his head. One cop shouted to the other. Shall we shoot him again for a bit? Yeah, why not? They let fly another electric barrage. The heat and noise was quite fantastic. Slowly the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted away and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back and waited for the end.
 Chapter XX. Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at. It was like a dried-out marsh, now barren of all vegetation, and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick. It was very cold. Zaford was clearly rather depressed about it. He stalked off by himself, and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground. The wind stung Arthur's eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his throat. However, the thing that stung most was his mind. It's fantastic, he said, and his own voice rattled his ears, sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere. Desolate hole, if you ask me, said Ford. I could have more fun in a cat litter. He felt a mounting sense of irritation. Of all the planets and all the star systems, of all the galaxy, many wild and exotic, seething with life, didn't he just have to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway? Not even a hot-dog stand in evidence. He stooped down and picked up a cold clod of earth, but there was nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of light-years to look at. No, insisted Arthur. Don't you understand? This is the first time I've actually stood on the surface of another planet, a whole alien world. Pity it's such a dump, though. Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them. She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zephod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join him. He seemed to be excited, but they couldn't clearly hear what he was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind. As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it seemed to be circular, a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide. Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was spattered with black and red lumps. They stopped and looked at a piece. It was wet, it was rubbery. With horror they suddenly realised that it was fresh whale-meat. At the top of the crater's lip they met Zephod. "'Look,' he said, pointing into the crater. In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm-whale that hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot. The silence was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian's throat. "'I suppose there's no point in trying to bury it,' murmured Arthur, and then wished he hadn't. "'Come,' said Zephod, and started back down into the crater. "'What, down there?' said Trillian, with severe distaste. "'Yeah,' said Zephod. "'Come on, I've got something to show you.' "'We can see it,' said Trillian. "'Nah, not that,' said Zephod. ''Something else. Come on.' They all hesitated. "'Come on,' insisted Zephod. "'I've found a way in.' "'In,' said Arthur in horror. "'Into the interior of the planet, an underground passage. The force of the whale's impact cracked it open, and that's where we have to go, where no man has trod these five million years, into the very depths of time itself.' Marvin started his ironical humming again. Zephod hit him and he shut up. With little shudders of disgust, they all followed Zephod down the incline into the crater, trying very hard to avoid looking at its unfortunate creator. "'Life,' said Marvin dolefully, "'loathe it or ignore it. You can't like it.' The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it, revealing a network of galleries and passages now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails. Zephod had made a start clearing a way into one of them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster. Dank air wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zephod shone a torch into it, little was visible in the dusty gloom. "'According to the legends,' he said, "'the Magrathians live most of their lives underground.' "'Why is that?' said Arthur. "'Did the surface become too polluted or overpopulated?' "'No, I don't think so,' said Zephod. "'I think they just didn't like it very much.' "'Are you sure you know what you're doing?' said Trillian, peering nervously into the darkness. "'We've been attacked once already, you know.' "'Look, kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus the four of us, so come on, let's get on in there. Hey, Earthman!' "'Arthur,' said Arthur. "'Yeah, could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of the passage, okay?' "'Guard?' said Arthur. "'What from? You just said there's no one here.' "'Yeah, well, just for safety, okay?' said Zephod. "'Whose? Yours or mine?' "'Good lad. Okay, here we go.'' Zephod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and Ford. "'Well, I hope you have a really miserable time,' complained Arthur. "'Don't worry,' Marvin assured him. ''They will.'' In a few seconds they had disappeared from view. Arthur stamped around in a huff and then decided that a whale's graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in. Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment and then turned himself off. Zephod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying to hide it by striding purposefully. He flung the torchbeam around. The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the touch, and the air thick with decay. "'There, what an atelier,' he said. "'An uninhabited planet. Magrathir!' And he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile floors. Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid. At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics, simple angular patterns in bright colours. Trillian stopped and studied one of them, but could not interpret any sense in them. She called to Zephod. "'Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?' "'Ay, I think they're just sort of strange symbols of some kind,' said Zephod, hardly glancing back. Trillian shrugged and hurried after him. From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish chambers, which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment. He dragged Zephod into one to have a look. Trillian followed. "'Look,' said Ford, "'you reckon this is Magrathir?' "'Yeah,' said Zephod, "'and we heard the voice, right?' "'Okay, so I've bought the fact that it's Magrathir. For the moment. "'What you have so far said nothing about is how in the galaxy you found it. "'You didn't look it up in a star atlas, that's for sure.' "'Oh, research, government archives, detective work, few lucky guesses, easy.' "'And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?' "'I stole it to look for a lot of things.' "'A lot of things?' said Ford, in surprise. "'Like what?' "'I don't know.' "'What?' "'I don't know what I'm looking for,' said Zephod. "'Why not?' "'Because—because—I think it—I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn't be able to look for them.' "'What are you, crazy?' "'It's a possibility I haven't ruled out yet,' said Zephod, quietly. "'I only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions, "'and its current conditions are not good.' "'For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zephod with a mind suddenly full of worry. "'Listen, old friend, if you want to—' started Ford eventually. "'No, wait. I'll tell you something,' said Zephod. "'I free-wheel a lot. I get an idea to do something, and hey, why not? I do it. "'I reckon I'll become president of the galaxy, and it just happens. It's easy. "'I decide to steal the ship. I decide to look for Magrathir, and it all just happens. "'Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always works out. "'It's like having a galactic credit card which keeps on working, though you never send off the checks. "'And then whenever I stop and think, why did I want to do something, how did I work out how to do it, "'I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it, like I have now. "'It's a big effort to talk about it.' "'Zephod paused for a while. For a while there was silence. "'Then he frowned and said, "'Last night I was worrying about this again, about the fact that part of my mind just didn't seem to work properly. "'Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, "'without telling me about it. "'I put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody "'had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I couldn't use it. "'I wondered if there was a way I could check. "'I went to the ship's medical bay and plugged myself into the encephalographic screen. "'I went through every major screening test on both my heads, "'all the tests I had to go through under the government medical officers "'before my nomination for presidency could be properly ratified. "'They showed up nothing, nothing unexpected at least. "'They showed that I was a clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy extrovert, "'nothing you couldn't have guessed, and no other anomalies. "'So I started inventing further tests, completely at random. Nothing. "'Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the results from the other head. "'Still nothing. "'Finally I got silly because I'd given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia. "'Last thing I did before I packed it in was to take the superimposed picture "'and look at it through a green filter. "'You remember I was always superstitious about the colour green when I was a kid? "'I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts.' "'Ford nodded. "'And there it was,' said Zafod, "'clear as day, "'a whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other "'and not to anything else around them. "'Some bastard had cauterised all the synapses "'and electronically traumatised these two lumps of cerebellum.' "'Ford stared at him aghast. Trillian had turned white. "'Somebody did that to you?' whispered Ford. "'Yeah.' "'But have you any idea who or why?' "'Why I can only guess, but I do know who the bastard was.' "'You know? How do you know?' said Ford. "'Because,' said Zafod, "'they left their initials burnt into the cauterised synapses. "'They left them there for me to see.' "'Ford stared at him in horror and felt a skin begin to crawl. "'Initials burnt into your brain?' "'Yeah.' "'Well, what were they, for God's sake?' "'Zafod looked at him in silence again for a moment. "'Then he looked away. "'ZB,' he said quietly. "'At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them "'and gas started to pour into the chamber. "'I'll tell you about it later,' choked Zafod as all three passed out.
 Chapter 16 Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge. Ford was waving his arms about. "'You're crazy,' Zaphod, he was saying. "'Magrathia is a myth, a fairy story. It's what parents tell their kids about at night. They want them to grow up to become economists. It's—' "'And that's what we are currently in orbit about,' insisted Zaphod. "'Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around,' said Ford. "'But this ship—' "'Computer!' shouted Zaphod. "'Oh, no. Hi there! This is Eddie, your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling just great, guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any program you care to run through me.' Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned him to come on in, but keep quiet. "'Computer,' said Zaphod, "'tell us again what our present trajectory is.' "'A real pleasure, fella,' it burbled. 'We are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of Magrathia.' "'Proving nothing,' said Ford. "'I wouldn't trust that computer to speak my weight.' "'I can do that for you, sure,' enthused the computer, punching out more ticker tape. "'I can even work out your personality problems in ten decimal places if it'll help.' Trillian interrupted. "'Zaphod,' she said, "'any minute now we will be swinging round to the daylight side of the planet,' adding whatever it turns out to be. "'Hey, what do you mean by that? The planet's where I predicted it would be, isn't it?' "'Yes, I know there's a planet there. I'm not arguing with anyone. It's just that I wouldn't know Magrathia from any other lump of cold rock. Dawn's coming up if you want it.' "'Okay, okay,' muttered Zaphod. "'Let's at least give our eyes a good time. Computer?' "'Hi there! What can I—' "'Shut up, and give us a view of the planet again.' A dark, featureless mass once more filled the screens, the planet rolling away beneath them. They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety with excitement. "'We are now traversing the night side,' he said in a hushed voice. The planet rolled on. "'The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us,' he continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion to what he felt should have been a great moment. Magrathia! He was piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction. "'In a few seconds,' he continued, "'we should see—' "'There!' The moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned Star Tramp can't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space. But a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the galaxy. Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light. It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire. Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them. "'The fires of dawn,' breathed Zaphod. "'The twin suns of Suleanus and Rahm.' "'Or whatever,' said Ford quietly. "'Suleanus and Rahm,' insisted Zaphod. The suns blazed into the pitch of space, and a low ghostly music floated through the bridge. Marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans so much. As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them, excitement burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet. It was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly irritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fancy onto the scene to make it work for him. All this Magrathia nonsense seemed juvenile. Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?' All this Magrathia business seemed totally incomprehensible to Arthur. He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on. "'I only know what Zaphod's told me,' she whispered. Apparently Magrathia is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes in, a bit like Atlantis on earth, except that the legends say the Magrathians used to manufacture planets.' Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. "'Is there any tea on this spaceship?' he asked. More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of Gold streaked along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in the black sky. The pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day. Grey, dusty, and only dimly contoured. It looked dead and cold as a crypt. From time to time promising features would appear on the distant horizon—ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities—but as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity, and nothing would transpire. The planet's surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin, stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century. Clearly it was very, very old. A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape move beneath them. The immensity of time worried him. He could feel it as a presence. He cleared his throat. Well, even supposing it is—'It is,' said Zayford. Which it isn't, continued Ford. What do you want with it, anyway? There's nothing there. Not on the surface, said Zayford. All right, just supposing there's something. I take it you're not here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all. What are you after? One of Zayford's heads looked away. The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at anything very much. Well, said Zayford, airily, it's partly curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's just the fame and the money. Ford glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that Zayford hadn't the faintest idea why he was there at all. You know, I don't like the look of that planet at all, said Trillian, shivering. Ah, take no notice, said Zayford. With half the wealth of the former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere, it can afford to look frumpy. Bullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now. He shrugged. I think it's just a dead planet, he said. The suspense is killing me, said Arthur testily. Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not be in any way exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance. The planet in question is, in fact, the legendary Magrathia. The deadly missile attack, shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defence system, will result merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a mouse-cage, the bruising of somebody's upper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm-whale. In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustains the bruise. This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense, since it is of no significance whatsoever.
 Chapter 5. Prosthetnic Vogon Joltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons. His highly domed nose rose high above a small, piggy forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon civil service politics and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects. Not that he ever went swimming, of course. His busy schedule would not allow it. He was the way he was because, billions of years ago, when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and lain panting and heaving on the planet's virgin shores, when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution had simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake. They never evolved again. They should never have survived. The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed, slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution, they said to themselves, who needs it? And what Nature refused to do for them they simply did without, until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery. Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They brought forth scintillating, jeweled, scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets. Tall, aspiring trees of breathtaking slenderness and colour, which the Vogons cut down and burnt the crab-meat with. Elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes, which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They were no use as transport, because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway. Thus, the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel. Within a few short Vog years, every last Vogon had migrated to the Megabrantes Cluster, the political hub of the galaxy, and they now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the galactic civil service. They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears. Every year they import 27,000 scintillating, jeweled, scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets. Prostetnic Vogon Joltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitchhikers. Somewhere in a small, dark cabin, buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Joltz's flagship, a small match flared nervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and he was right to be nervous. His name was Ford Prefect. Ford Prefect's original name is only pronounceable in an obscure Betelgeusean dialect, now virtually extinct since the great collapsing Hurung disaster of Galactic Sidereal Year 03758, which wiped out all the old Praxebetel communities on Betelgeuse 7. Ford's father was the only man on the entire planet to survive the great collapsing Hurung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep mystery. In fact, no one ever knew what a Hurung was, nor why it had chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse 7, particularly. Ford's father, magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to live on Betelgeuse 5, where he both fathered and unculled Ford. In memory of his now dead race, he christened him in the ancient Praxebetel tongue. Because Ford never learnt to say his original name, his father eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the galaxy. The other kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse 5 translates as, ìBoy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hurung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse 7.î Ford looked about the cabin, but could see very little. Strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank-you to the Dentrasses. The Dentrasses are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch, whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long-haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves. This suited the Dentrasses fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassy liked to see was an annoyed Vogon. It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone, and carbon monoxide. He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he took the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for, and took it out. He ripped it open and shook it. He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again. Ford Prefect said, I bought some peanuts. Arthur Dent moved and groaned again, muttering incoherently. Here, have some, urged Ford, shaking the packet again. If you've never been through a matter transference beam before, you've probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit. I'm so sorry. Said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes. It's dark, he said. Yes, said Ford Prefect. It's dark. No light, said Arthur Dent. Dark. No, no light. One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very, very obvious, as in, It's a nice day, or, You're very tall, or, Oh dear, you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well. Are you all right? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well, as being obstructively cynical, and decided he quite liked human beings, after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn't know about. Yes, he agreed with Arthur. No light. He helped Arthur to some peanuts. How do you feel? he asked him. Like a military academy, said Arthur. Bits of me keep on passing out. Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness. If I asked you where the hell we were, said Arthur weakly, would I regret it? Ford stood up. We're safe, he said. Oh good, said Arthur. We're in a small galley cabin, said Ford, in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet. Ah, said Arthur, this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware of. Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him. The air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low, irritating hum kept his brain from focusing. How did we get here? he asked, shivering slightly. We hitched a lift, said Ford. Excuse me, said Arthur. Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his head out and said, hi, fellas, hop right in, I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout? Well, said Ford, the thumbs an electronic sub-ether signalling device, the roundabout at Barnard Star, six light-years away, but otherwise that's more or less right. And the bug-eyed monster? Is green, yes. Fine, said Arthur. When can I go home? You can't, said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch. Shade your eyes, he said, and turned it on. And Ford was surprised. Good grief, said Arthur. Is this really the interior of a flying saucer? Prostatnik Vogonjeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets. He wished that someone would come and tell him it was all wrong, so he could shout at them and feel better. He flopped as heavily as he could onto his control seat, in the hope that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak. Go away, he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved. He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered the report they'd just received. The report was an official release, which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran, which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes unnecessary. Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't shout, because it was the door from the galley quarters where the Dantrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome. A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray. It was grinning like a maniac. Prostatnik Vogonjeltz was delighted. He knew that when a Dantrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry about, indeed. Ford and Arthur stared around them. Well, what do you think? said Ford. It's a bit squalid, isn't it? Ford frowned at the grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin. Well, this is a working ship, you see, said Ford. These are Dantrassi's sleeping quarters. I thought you said they were called Vogons or something, said Arthur. Yes, said Ford. The Vogons are on the ship. The Dantrassis are the cooks. They let us on board. I'm confused, said Arthur. Here, have a look at this, said Ford. He sat down on one of the mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and then sat on it himself. In fact, he had very little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of Squanchella Zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to life again. Ford handed the book to Arthur. What is it? asked Arthur. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic book. It tells you everything you need to know about anything. That's its job. Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands. I like the cover, he said. Don't panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day. I'll show you how it works, said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur, who was still holding it, as if it was a two-week dead lark, and pulled it out of its cover. You press this button here, you see, and the screen lights up, giving you the index. A screen about three inches by four lit up, and characters began to flicker across the surface. You want to know about Vogons, so I entered that name. So. Arthur's fingers tapped some more keys, and there we are. The words, Vogon Constructor Fleets, flared in green across the screen. Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen, and words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well, in a still, quiet, measured voice. This is what the book said. Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon. Forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy, not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious, and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the ravenous bug-blatter beast of trial, without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire-lighters. The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the ravenous bug-blatter beast of trial. On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you. Arthur blinked at it. What a strange book! How did we get a lift, then? That's the point. It's out of date now," said Ford, sliding the book back into its cover. I'm doing the field research for the new revised edition, and one of the things I'll have to include is a bit about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassy cooks, which gives us rather a useful little loophole." A pained expression crossed Arthur's face. But who are the Dentrassy? he said. Oh, great guys, said Ford. They're the best cooks and the best drinks-mixers, and they don't give a wet slap about anything else, and they'll always help hitchhikers aboard. Partly because they like the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons, which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you're an impoverished hitchhiker trying to see the marvels of the universe for less than thirty Altarian dollars a day. And that's my job. Fun, isn't it?" Arthur looked lost. It's amazing, he said, and frowned at one of the other mattresses. Unfortunately, I got stuck on the earth rather longer than I intended, said Ford. I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years. But how did you get there in the first place, then? Oh, easy. I got a lift with a teaser. A teaser? Yeah. Er, what is a... a teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They cruise around looking for planets which haven't made interstellar contact yet and buzz them. Buzz them? Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life difficult for him. Yeah, said Ford. They buzz them. They find some isolated spot, very few people around, then they land right by some poor unsuspecting soul whom no one's ever going to believe, and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on their head and making beep-beep noises. Rather childish, really. Ford leant back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with himself. Ford, insisted Arthur, I don't know if this sounds like a silly question, but what am I doing here? Well you know that, said Ford. I rescued you from the earth. And erm, what's happened to the earth? Ah, it's been demolished. Has it? said Arthur, levelly. Yes, it just boiled away into space. Look, said Arthur, I'm a bit upset about that. Ford frowned himself and seemed to roll the thought around in his mind. Yes, I can understand that, he said at last. Understand that, shouted Arthur. Understand that. The thought sprang up. Keep looking at the book, he hissed urgently. What? Don't panic. I'm not panicking. Yes, you are. All right, so I am panicking. What else is there to do? You just come along with me and have a good time. The galaxy's a fun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear. I beg your pardon, said Arthur, rather politely, he thought. Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him. He wished there was something simple and recognisable he could grasp hold of. He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassie underwear, the piles of squancherless mattresses, and the man from Beetlejuice holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear, if he had been able to see just a small packet of cornflakes. But he couldn't, and he didn't feel safe. Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he could identify. He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves. Shh, said Ford. Listen, it might be important. Important? It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the tannoy. You mean that's how Vogons talk? Listen. But I can't speak, Vogon. You don't need to. Just put this fish in your ear. Ford with a lightning movement clapped his hand to Arthur's ear, and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep into his oral tract. Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned goggle-eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick, or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper, which suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of glasses. He was still listening to the howling goggles. He knew that. Only now it had somehow taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward English. This is what he heard.
 Chapter 1. The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its own and looked out over a broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means. It was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London, because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark-haired, and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio, which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too. Most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily. The lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday-morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent's house for what was to be the last time. It hadn't properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush, so scrub. Shaving mirror, pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee, yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it. Yellow, he thought, and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water and another. He began to suspect that he was hungover. Why was he hungover? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. Yellow, he thought, and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He had been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected. His clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces. Something about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months, only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he decided. No one wanted a bypass. The council didn't have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God, what a terrible hangover it had earned him, though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. Yellow, he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up the garden path. Mr. L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words, he was a carbon-based bipedal life-form descended from an ape. More specifically, he was forty, fat, and shabby, and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L. Prosser, of his mighty ancestry, were a pronounced stoutness about the tongue and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior. In fact, he was a nervous, worried man. To-day he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job, which was to see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. "'Come off it, Mr. Dent,' he said. "'You can't win, you know. You can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.' He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely, but they just wouldn't do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. "'I'm game,' he said. "'We'll see who rusts first.' "'I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it,' said Mr. Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head. "'This bypass has got to be built, and it's going to be built.' "'First I've heard of it,' said Arthur. "'Why's it got to be built?' Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. "'What do you mean, why's it got to be built?' he said. "'It's a bypass. You've got to build bypasses!'' Bypasses are devices which allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast, whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in particular. It was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife, of course, wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't know why, he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent, and he hoped to God it wasn't him. Mr. Prosser said, You are quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know. Appropriate time? hooted Arthur. Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my house yesterday. I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said no, he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away, of course. No, no, first he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver, then he told me. But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months. Oh yes, said Arthur. Well, as soon as I heard, I went straight round to see them yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like, actually telling anybody or anything. But the plans were on display. On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them. Well, that's the display department. With a torch. Ah, well, the lights had probably gone. So had the stairs. But look, you found the notice, didn't you? Yes, said Arthur. Yes, I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet, stuck in a disused lavatory, with a sign on the door saying, Beware of the Leopard. A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent's house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. It's not as if it's a particularly nice house, he said. I'm sorry, but I happen to like it. You like the bypass. Oh, shut up, said Arthur Dent. Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven't got a leg to stand on, and you know it. Mr. Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times, whilst his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire, and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin, with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these, and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment, and then pulled himself together. Mr. Dent, he said. Hello? Yes, said Arthur. Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer, if I just let it roll straight over you? How much? said Arthur. None at all, said Mr. Prosser, and stormed nervously off, wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him. By a curious coincidence, none at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and not from Guildford, as he usually claimed. Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this. This friend of his had first arrived on the planet Earth some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society, with, it must be said, some success. For instance, he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out-of-work actor, which was plausible enough. He had made one careless blunder, though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name Ford Prefect, as being nicely inconspicuous. He was not conspicuously tall. His features were striking, but not conspicuously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish, and brushed backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn't seem to blink often enough, and when you talked to him for any length of time, your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly, and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck. He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one, an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance, he would often gate-crash university parties, get badly drunk, and start making fun of any astrophysicists he could find till he got thrown out. Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods, and stare into the sky as if hypnotised, until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he would start, guiltily for a moment, relax and grin. "'Oh, just looking for flying saucers,' he would joke, and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for. "'Green ones,' he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment, and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks. Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into the corner with some girl, and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't matter that much, really. Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets, he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Beetlejuice. The policeman would usually say something like, "'Don't you think it's time you went off home, sir?' "'I'm trying to, baby, I'm trying to,' is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions. In fact, what he was really looking for, when he stared distractedly into the sky, was any kind of flying saucer at all. The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the Beetlejuice trading scouts. Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon, because fifteen years is a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mind-bogglingly dull as the earth. Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon, because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. He knew how to see the marvels of the universe for less than thirty Altarian dollars a day. In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Human beings are great adapters, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine. It was Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud, making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother, or a good book. It was Mr. Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy, such as the for-the-public-good talk, or the march-of-progress talk, or the they-knock-my-house-down-once-you-know-never-look-back talk, and various other cajoleries and threats. And it was the bulldozer driver's accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage. The earth moved slowly in its diurnal course. The sun was beginning to dry out the mud that Arthur lay in. A shadow moved across him again. "'Hello, Arthur,' said the shadow. Arthur looked up, and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him. "'Ford! Hello, how are you?' "'Fine,' said Ford. Look, are you busy?' "'Am I busy?' exclaimed Arthur. "'Well, I've just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of, because they'll knock my house down if I don't. But other than that, well, well, no, not especially why.' They don't have sarcasm on Beetlejuice, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, "'Good. Is there any way we can talk?' "'What?' said Arthur Dent. For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur. "'We've got to talk,' he said urgently. "'Fine,' said Arthur. "'Talk and drink,' said Ford. "'It's vitally important that we talk and drink. Now we'll go to the pub in the village.' He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant. "'Look, don't you understand?' shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. "'That man wants to knock my house down.' Ford glanced at him, puzzled. "'Well, he can do it while you're away, can't he?' he asked. "'But I don't want him to.' "'Ah. Look, what's the matter with you, Ford?' said Arthur. "'Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me. I've got to tell you the most important thing you've ever heard. I've got to tell you now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom.' "'But why?' "'Because you're going to need a very stiff drink.' Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find his will beginning to weaken. He didn't realise that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford had learnt to play in the hyperspace ports that serve the Madronite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta. The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this. Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them. Between them would be placed a bottle of Jank's Spirit, as immortalised in that ancient Orion mining song. "'Oh, don't give me none more of that old Jank's Spirit. No, don't give me none more of that old Jank's Spirit, for my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry, and I may die. Won't you pour me one more of that sinful old Jank's Spirit?' Each of the contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle, and attempt to tip it and pour Spirit into the glass of his opponent, who would then have to drink it. The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played again, and again. Once you started to lose, you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Jank's Spirit is to depress telepsychic power. As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological. Ford Prefect usually played to lose. Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the horse and groom after all. "'But what about my house?' he asked plaintively. Ford looked across to Mr. Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him. "'He wants to knock your house down.' "'Yes, he wants to build, and he can't, because you're lying in front of his bulldozer.' "'Yes, and I'm sure we can come to some arrangement,' said Ford. "'Excuse me!' he shouted. Mr. Prosser, who was arguing with the spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did, looked around. He was surprised and slightly alarmed to see that Arthur had company. "'Hello? Yes?' he called. "'Has Mr. Dent come to his senses yet?' "'Can we for the moment,' called Ford, "'assume that he hasn't?' "'Well,' sighed Mr. Prosser. "'And can we also assume,' said Ford, "'that he's going to be staying here all day?' "'So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?' "'Could be, could be. "'Well, if you're assigned to doing that anyway, "'you don't actually need him to lie here all the time, do you?' "'What?' "'You don't,' said Ford patiently, "'actually need him here.' Mr. Prosser thought about this. "'Well, no, not as such,' he said. "'Not exactly need?' Prosser was worried. "'He thought that one of them wasn't making a lot of sense. "'Ford said, "'So if you'd just like to take it as read that he's actually here, "'then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an hour. "'How does that sound?' Mr. Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty. "'That sounds perfectly reasonable,' he said in a reassuring turn of voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure. "'And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on,' said Ford, "'we can always cover for you in return.' "'Oh, thank you very much,' said Mr. Prosser, "'who no longer knew how to play this at all. "'Oh, thank you very much, yes, that's very kind.' "'He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, "'failed, grasped hold of his fur hat "'and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head. "'He could only assume that he had just won. "'So,' continued Ford Prefect, "'if you'd just like to come over here and lie down.' "'What?' said Mr. Prosser. "'Ah, I'm sorry,' said Ford, perhaps I hadn't made myself fully clear. "'Somebody's got to lie in front of the bulldozers, haven't they? "'Or there won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr. Dent's house, will there?' "'What?' said Mr. Prosser again. "'It's very simple,' said Ford. "'My client, Mr. Dent, says that he will stop lying here in the mud "'on the sole condition that you come and take over from him.' "'What are you talking about?' said Arthur. "'But Ford nudged him with his shoe to be quiet. "'You want me,' said Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, "'to come and lie there?' "'Yes.' "'In front of the bulldozer?' "'Yes.' "'Instead of Mr. Dent?' "'Yes.' "'In the mud?' "'In, as you say, the mud.' "'As soon as Mr. Prosser realised that he was substantially the loser after all, "'it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders. "'This was more like the world as he knew it.' "'He sighed. "'In return for which, you will take Mr. Dent with you down to the pub.' "'That's it,' said Ford. "'That's it exactly.' "'Mr. Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped. "'Promise?' he said. "'Promise,' said Ford. He turned to Arthur. "'Come on,' he said to him. "'Get up and let the man lie down.' "'Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.' Ford beckoned to Prosser, who, sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud. He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream, and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it. The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes. Arthur looked at him severely. "'And no sneaky knocking Mr. Dent's house down while he's away, all right?' he said. "'The mere thought,' growled Mr. Prosser. "'Hadn't even begun to speculate,' he continued, settling himself back, "'about the merest possibility of crossing my mind.' He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching, and let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about this. His mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserable or put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to himself. In a high dimension of which we know nothing, the mighty Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr. Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered. He began to feel little pricks of water behind his eyelids. Bureaucratic cock-ups, angry men lying in mud, indecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations, and an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head. What a day! What a day! Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of dingoes' kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not now. Arthur remained very worried. "'But can we trust him?' he said. "'Myself, I trust him to the end of the earth,' said Ford. "'Oh, yes,' said Arthur. "'And how far's that?' "'About twelve minutes away,' said Ford. ''Come on, I need a drink.'
 Vogon poetry is, of course, the third worst in the universe. The second worst is that of the Asgoths of Crea. During a recitation by their poet-master, Grunthos the Flatulent, of his poem, Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit, one midsummer morning, four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Novelling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been disappointed by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles, when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and civilisation, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain. The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator, Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings, of Greenbridge, Essex, England, in the destruction of the planet Earth. Prostetnik Vogon Jelts smiled very slowly. This was not done so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements. He had had a terribly therapeutic yell at his prisoners, and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little callousness. The prisoners sat in poetry-appreciation chairs, strapped in. Vogon suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were generally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been part of a bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved and cultured race, but now the only thing that kept them going was sheer bloody-mindedness. The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round the electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to a battery of electronic equipment, imagery intensifiers, rhythmic modulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers, all designed to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure that not a single nuance of the poet's thought was lost. Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for, but he knew that he hadn't liked anything that had happened so far, and didn't think things were likely to change. The Vogon began to read, a fetid little passage of his own devising. O frettled grunt-buggly! He began. Spasms racked Ford's body. This was worse than even he had been prepared for. Thy micturations are to me As plurdled gabble-blotchets on a lurgid bee. Went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head back as lumps of pain thumped through it. He could dimly see beside him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his teeth. Group, I implore thee, continued the merciless Vogon, my footing, turling-dromes. His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency. Then, hopelessly, drangle me with crankly bindle-wurdles, or I will rend thee in the gobble-warts with my blurgle-crunch, and see if I don't! Narrrrrrrr-arrrrrrrrg! cried Ford Prefect, and through one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of the last line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp. Arthur lolled. "'Now, earthlings,' whirred the Vogon. He didn't know that Fort Prefect was, in fact, from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Beetlejuice, and wouldn't have cared if he had. "'I present you with a simple choice. Either die in the vacuum of space, or,' he paused for melodramatic effect, "'tell me how good you thought my poem was!' He threw himself backwards into a huge, leathery bat-shaped seat and watched them. He did the smile again. Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his parched mouth and moaned. Arthur said brightly, "'Actually, I quite liked it.' Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simply not occurred to him. The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his nose, and was therefore no bad thing. "'Oh, good!' he whirred in considerable astonishment. "'Oh, yes,' said Arthur. "'I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly effective.' Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organising his thoughts round this totally new concept. Were they really going to be able to bare-face their way out of this? "'Yes. Do continue,' invited the Vogon. "'Oh, and interesting rhythmic devices too,' continued Arthur, "'which seem to counterpoint the'—' he floundered. Ford leapt to his rescue, hazarding—'counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the'—' he floundered too, but Arthur was ready again. "'Humanity of the'—'Vogonity,' Ford hissed at him. "'Oh, yes, Vogonity, sorry, of the poet's compassionate soul'—'Arthur felt he was on the home stretch now—'which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other'—'he was reaching a triumphant crescendo—'and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into'—'uh, uh'—'which suddenly gave out on him—'Ford leapt in with the coupe de gras'—'into whatever it was the poem was about'—'he yelled.' Out of the corner of his mouth, "'Well done, Arthur, that was very good.' The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul had been touched, but he thought, no, too little too late. His voice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon. "'So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean, callous, heartless exterior I really just want to be loved,' he said. "'Is that right?' Ford laughed a nervous laugh. "'Well, I mean, yes,' he said. "'Don't we all, deep down, you know?' The Vogon stood up. "'No, well, you're completely wrong,' he said. "'I just write poetry to throw my mean, callous, heartless exterior into sharp relief. I'm going to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard, take the prisoners to No. 3 airlock and throw them out.' "'What?' shouted Ford. A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery arms. "'You can't throw us into space!' yelled Ford. "'We're trying to write a book!' "'Resistance is useless!' shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It was the first phrase he'd learnt when he joined the Vogon guard corps. The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away. Arthur stared round him wildly. "'I don't want to die now!' he yelled. "'I've still got a headache. I don't want to go to heaven with a headache. I'll be all cross and wouldn't enjoy it!' The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck and, bowing deferentially towards his captain's back, hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain was on his own again. He hummed quietly and mused to himself, lightly fingering his notebook of verses. "'Hm,' he said. "'Counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor.' He considered this for a moment and then closed the book with a grim smile. "'Death's too good for them,' he said.' The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two humanoids clamped firmly under the rubbery Vogon armpits. "'This is great!' spluttered Arthur. "'This is really terrific. Let go of me, you brute!' The Vogon guard dragged them on. "'Don't you worry,' said Ford. 'I'll think of something.' He didn't sound too hopeful. "'Resistance is useless!' bellowed the guard. "'Just don't say things like that, stammered Ford. How can anyone maintain a positive mental attitude if you're saying things like that?' "'My God!' complained Arthur. "'You're talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog. It's now just after four in the afternoon and I'm already being thrown out of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!' He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip. "'All right,' said Ford. 'Just stop panicking!' "'Who said anything about panicking?' snapped Arthur. 'This is still just culture shock. You wait till I've settled down to the situation and found my bearings. Then I'll start panicking!' "'Arthur, you're getting hysterical. Shut up!' Ford tried desperately to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again. "'Resistance is useless!' "'You can shut up as well,' snapped Ford. "'Resistance is useless!' "'Oh, give it a rest!' said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captor's face. A thought struck him. "'Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?' he asked suddenly. The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over his face. "'Enjoy?' he boomed. "'What do you mean?' "'What I mean,' said Ford, "'is does it give you a full, satisfying life? I mean stomping round, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships?' The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he said, "'Well, the hours are good.' "'They'd have to be,' agreed Ford. Arthur twisted his head round to look at Ford. "'Ford, what are you doing?' he asked in an amazed whisper. "'Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me. OK?' he said. "'So the hours are pretty good, then,' he resumed. The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths. "'Yeah,' he said, "'but now you come to mention it, most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy.' "'Except,' he thought again, which required looking at the ceiling, "'except some of the shouting I quite like.' He filled his lungs and bellowed. "'Resistances!' "'Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure,' interrupted Ford hurriedly. "'You're good at that, I can tell. But if it's mostly lousy,' he said, slowly, giving the words time to reach their mark, ''then why do you do it? What is it? "'The bells, the leather, the machismo, or do you just find that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge?' Arthur looked backwards and forwards between them in bafflement. "'Urgh!' said the guard. "'Urgh! I don't know. I think I just sort of do it, really. My aunt said that a spaceship guard was a good career for a young Vogon. "'You know, the uniform, the low-slung stun-ray holster, the mindless tedium.' "'There you are, Arthur,' said Ford, with the air of someone reaching the conclusion of his argument. "'You think you've got problems?' Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business with his home planet, the Vogon guard had half-throttled him already, and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space very much. "'Try and understand his problem,' insisted Ford. "'Here he is, poor lad. His entire life's work is stamping round, throwing people off spaceships, and shouting!' added the guard. "'And shouting, sure,' said Ford, patting the blubbery arm clamped round his neck in friendly condescension. "'And he doesn't even know why he's doing it!' Arthur agreed. This was very sad. He did this with a small, feeble gesture, because he was too asphyxiated to speak. Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard. "'Well, now you put it like that, I suppose. Good lad!' encouraged Ford. "'But—' "'All right,' went on the rumblings. "'So what's the alternative?' "'Well,' said Ford, brightly but slowly, "'stop doing it, of course. Tell them,' he went on, "'you're not going to do it any more.' He felt he ought to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his mind occupied, pondering that much. "'Mmm!' said the guard. "'Mm? Well, that doesn't sound that great to me.' Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away. "'No, no, wait a minute,' he said. "'That's just a start, you see. There's more to it than that, you see.' But at that moment the guard renewed his grip, and continued his original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was obviously quite touched. "'No, I think it was all the same to you,' he said. "'I'd better get you both shoved into this airlock, and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting I've got to do.' It wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect at all. "'Come on now, but look!' he said, less slowly, less brightly. "'Mmm!' said Arthur, without any clear inflection. "'But hang on!' pursued Ford. "'There's music and art and things to tell you about. Oh!' "'Resistance is useless!' bellowed the guard, and then added, "'You see, if I can keep it up, I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non-shouting and non-pushing people about, officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I know.' They had now reached the airlock. A large circular steel hatchway of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft. The guard operated the control, and the hatchway swung smoothly open. "'But thanks for taking an interest,' said the Vogon guard. "'Why, now!' he flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway. "'But listen!' he shouted to the guard. "'There's a whole world you don't know anything about yet. Here, how about this?' Desperately he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand. He hummed the first bar of Beethoven's Fifth. "'Dun-dun-dun-dun! Doesn't that stir anything in you?' "'No,' said the guard. "'Not really, but I'll mention it to my aunt.' If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost bar the faint distant hum of the ship's engines. They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diameter and ten feet long. Ford looked around at Panting. "'A potentially bright lad, I thought,' he said, and slumped against the curved wall. Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen. He didn't look up. He just lay panting. "'We're trapped now, aren't we?' "'Yes,' said Ford. "'We're trapped.' "'But didn't you think of anything? I thought you said you were going to think of something. Perhaps you thought of something I didn't notice?' "'Oh, yes. I thought of something,' panted Ford. Arthur looked up expectantly. But unfortunately,' continued Ford, "'it rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway.' He kicked the hatch they'd just been thrown through. "'But it was a good idea, was it?' "'Oh, yes. It was very neat.' "'What was it?' "'Well, I hadn't worked out all the details yet. Not much point now, is there?' "'So, uh, what happens next?' asked Arthur. "'Oh, well, uh, the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few moments, and we will shoot out into deep space, I expect, and, um, asphyxiate. I mean, if you breathe hard for a few moments beforehand and then expel all the air from your lungs, you can last out there for, oh, a good thirty seconds,' said Ford." He stuck his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows, and started to hum an old Beetlejuice in battle hymn. To Arthur's eyes he suddenly looked very alien. "'So this is it?' said Arthur. "'We're going to die!' "'Yes,' said Ford. "'Except no! Wait a minute!' He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. "'What's this switch?' he cried. "'What? Where?' cried Arthur, twisting around. "'No, I was only fooling,' said Ford. 'We are going to die, after all.' He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he'd left off. "'You know,' said Arthur, "'it's at times like this when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Beetlejuice and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.' "'Why? What did she tell you?' "'I don't know! I didn't listen!' Oh." Ford carried on humming. "'This is terrific!' Arthur thought to himself. "'Nelson's column's gone, McDonald's have gone, and all that's left is me, and the word's mostly harmless. Any second now all that will be left is mostly harmless.' "'And yesterday the planet seemed to be doing so well!' A motor word. A slight hiss spilt into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatchway opened onto an empty blackness studded with tiny, impossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped into outer space like corks from a toy gun.
 Chapter 11. The improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a perfectly conventional spaceship, except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats hadn't had the plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish restaurant. In fact, it wasn't perfectly oblong. The two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners of the cabin were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes. The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three-dimensional oblong room, but then the designers would have got miserable. As it was, the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees. It, too, was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and polished, it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid body didn't quite fit properly. In fact, they fitted perfectly well, but something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better. Zephod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement. Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments, reading off figures. Her voice was carried around the tannoy system of the whole ship. "'Five to one against and falling,' she said. "'Four to one against and falling. Three to one. Two. One. Probability factor of one to one. We have normality. I repeat, we have normality.' She turned her microphone off, then turned it back on with a slight smile, and continued, ''Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon.' Zephod burst out in annoyance. "'Who are they, Trillian?' Trillian spun her seat round to face him and shrugged. "'Just a couple of guys who seem to have picked up in open space,' she said. "'Sector ZZ-9, plural Z-alpha.' "'Yeah, well, that's a very sweet thought, Trillian,' complained Zephod. "'But do you really think it's wise under the circumstances? I mean, here we are, on the run and everything. We must have the police of half the galaxy after us by now, and we stopped to pick up hitchhikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, OK?' He tapped irritably at the control panel. Trillian quietly moved his hands before he tapped anything important. Whatever Zephod's qualities of mind might include—dash, bravado, conceit—he was mechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life was that he never really understood the significance of anything he did. "'Zephod,' she said patiently, 'they were floating unprotected in open space. You wouldn't want them to have died, would you?' "'Well, you know, no, not as such, but—' "'Not as such? Not die as such?' "'But—' Trillian cocked her head on one side. "'Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later.' "'A second later and they would have been dead.' "'Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a bit longer it would have gone away, huh?' "'You would have been happy to let them die?' "'Well, you know, not happy as such, but—' "'Anyway,' said Trillian, turning back to the controls, 'I didn't pick them up.' "'What do you mean? Who picked them up, then?' "'The ship did.' "'Huh?' "'The ship did, all by itself.' "'Huh?' "'Whilst we were in Improbability Drive.' "'But that's incredible!' "'No, Zaphod, just very, very improbable.' "'Uh, yeah.' "'Look, Zaphod,' she said, patting his arm, '-don't worry about the aliens. There's a couple of guys, I expect. I'll send the robot down to get them and bring them up here. Hey, Marvin!' In the corner the robot's head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier than it actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room. It stopped in front of Trillian and seemed to stare through her left shoulder. "'I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed,' it said. Its voice was low and hopeless. "'Oh, God!' muttered Zaphod, and slumped into a seat. "'Well,' said Trillian, in a bright, compassionate tone, '-here's something to occupy you and keep your mind off things.' "'It won't work,' droned Marvin. 'I have an exceptionally large mind.' "'Marvin,' warned Trillian. "'All right,' said Marvin. 'What do you want me to do?' "'Go down to No. 2 Entry Bay and bring the two aliens up here under surveillance.' With a microsecond pause and a finely calculated micro-modulation of pitch and timbre, nothing you could actually take offence at, Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human. "'Just that?' he said. "'Yes,' said Trillian firmly. "'I won't enjoy it,' said Marvin. Zaphod leapt out of his seat. "'She's not asking you to enjoy it,' he shouted. "'Just do it, will you?' "'All right,' said Marvin, like the tolling of a great cracked bell. "'I'll do it.' "'Good,' snapped Zaphod. "'Great. Thank you.' Marvin turned and lifted his flat-topped, triangular red eyes up towards him. "'I'm not getting you down at all, am I?' he said pathetically. "'No, no, Marvin,' lilted Trillian. "'That's just fine, really.' "'I wouldn't like to think I was getting you down.' "'No, don't worry about that,' the lilt continued. "'You just act as comes naturally, and everything will be just fine.' "'You're sure you don't mind?' probed Marvin. "'No, no, Marvin,' lilted Trillian. "'That's just fine, really. Just part of life.' Marvin flashed an electronic look. "'Life!' said Marvin. "'Don't talk to me about life.' He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the cabin. With a satisfied hum and click, the door closed behind him. "'I don't think I can stand that robot much longer,' Zaphod growled Trillian. The Encyclopedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as your plastic pal who's fun to be with. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes, with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics correspondent. Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came." The pink cubicle had winked out of existence. The monkeys had sunk away to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves in the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart. "'I think this ship's brand new,' said Ford. "'How can you tell?' asked Arthur. "'Have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal?' "'No, I just found the sales brochure lying on the floor. It's a lot of the universe can be yours stuff. Ah, look, look, I was right!' Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur. "'It says, sensational new breakthrough in improbability physics. As soon as the ship's drive reaches infinite improbability, it passes through every point in the universe. Be the envy of other major governments. Wow, this is big league stuff!' Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read. Clearly galactic astro-technology had moved ahead during the years of his exile. Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast majority of what Ford was saying, he began to let his mind wander. Trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words, "'Please do not press this button again.' He shook himself. "'Listen,' said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure. "'They make a big thing of the ship's cybernetics. A new generation of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers, with the new GPP feature.' "'GPP feature,' said Arthur. What's that?' "'Oh, it says, uh, genuine people personalities.' "'Yeah,' said Arthur. Sounds ghastly.' A voice behind them said, "'It is.' The voice was low and hopeless, and accompanied by a slight clanking sound. They spun round and saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway. "'What?' they said. "'Ghastly,' continued Marvin. "'It all is absolutely ghastly. Just don't even talk about it. Look at this door,' he said, stepping through it. The irony circuit cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure. "'All the doors in the spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done.' As the door closed behind them, it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied, sigh-like quality to it. "'Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm!' it said.' Marvin regarded it with cold loathing, whilst his logic circuits chatted with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it. Further circuits cut in, saying, "'Why bother? What's the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in.' Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components of the door and of the humanoid's brain cells. For a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space, and then shut down again in boredom. A spasm of despair shook the robot's body as he turned. "'Come on,' he droned. "'I've been ordered to take you down to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction, because I don't.' He turned and walked back to the hated door. "'Excuse me,' said Ford, following after him, "'which government owns this ship?' Marvin ignored him. "'You watch this door,' he muttered. "'It's about to open again. I can tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates.' With an ingratiating little whine the door slid open again, and Marvin stomped through. "'Come on,' he said. The others followed quickly, and the door slid back into place with pleased little clicks and whirs. "'Thank you, the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation,' said Marvin, and trudged desolately up the gleaming curved corridor that stretched out before them. "'Let's build robots with genuine people personalities,' they said. So they tried it out with me. I'm a personality prototype. You can tell, can't you?' Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers. "'I hate that door,' continued Marvin. "'I'm not getting you down at all, am I?' "'Which government?' started Ford again. "'No government owns it,' snapped the robot. "'It's been stolen.' "'Stolen?' said Ford. "'Stolen?' mimicked Marvin. "'Who buy us, Ford? Zayford Beeblebrox?' Something extraordinary happened to Ford's face. At least five entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement piled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid-stride, seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again. He stared at the robot and tried to disentangle some datoid muscles. "'Zayford Beeblebrox?' he said weakly. "'Sorry, did I say something wrong?' said Marvin, dragging himself on regardless. "'Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway, so I don't know why I bothered to say it. Oh God, I'm so depressed. Here's another of those self-satisfied doors. Life! Don't talk to me about life!' "'No one even mentioned it,' muttered Arthur irritably. "'Ford, are you all right?' Ford stared at him. "'Did that robot say Zayford Beeblebrox?' he said.
 XXIX Zafod, wake up! Hey, come on, wake up! Oh, just let me stick to what I'm good at, yeah, muttered Zafod, and rolled away from the voice, back to sleep. Do you want me to kick you? said Ford. Would it give you a lot of pleasure? said Zafod, blearily. No. Nor me. So what's the point? Stop bugging me! Zafod curled himself up. He got a double dose of the gas, said Trillian, looking down at him. Two windpipes. And stop talking, said Zafod. It's hard enough trying to sleep anyway. What's the matter with the ground? It's all cool and hard. It's gold, said Ford. With an amazingly balletic movement, Zafod was standing and scanning the horizon, because that was how far the gold ground stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth and solid. It gleamed like—it's impossible to say what it gleamed like, because nothing in the universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet made of solid gold does. Who put all that there? yelped Zafod, goggle-eyed. Don't get excited, said Ford. It's only a catalogue. A who? A catalogue, said Trillian. An illusion. How can you say that? cried Zafod, falling to his hands and knees and staring at the ground. He poked it and prodded it. It was very heavy and very slightly soft. He could mark it with his fingernail. It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it, his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold. Trillian and I came round a while ago, said Ford. We shouted and yelled till somebody came, and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us. This is all censor tape. Zafod stared at him bitterly. Ah, shit, he said. You wake me up from my own perfectly good dream to show me somebody else's? He sat down in a huff. What's that series of valleys over there? he said. Hallmark, said Ford. We had a look. We didn't wake you up earlier, said Trillian. The last planet was knee-deep in fish. Fish? Some people like the oddest things. And before that, said Ford, we had platinum. Bit dull. We thought you'd like to see this one, though. Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked. Very pretty, said Zafod petulantly. In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared. It flickered and changed, and when they looked round again so had the land. As for the one voice, they all went, Yuck! The sea was purple. The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green pebbles, presumably terribly precious stones. The mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks. Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassels. In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathia can cater for you. We are not proud. And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes. In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime meadow full of cows. Ah, said Zafod, my brains! You want to talk about it? said Ford. Yeah, OK, said Zafod, and all three sat down and ignored the scenes that came and went around them. I figure this, said Zafod. Whatever happened to my mind, I did it, and I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the government screening tests, and I wasn't to know anything about it myself. Pretty crazy, right? The other two nodded in agreement. So I reckon, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is, I don't know, obviously. But I put a few things together and I can begin to guess. When did I decide to run for President? Shortly after the death of President Euden Vrancks. You remember Euden, Ford? Yeah, said Ford. He was that guy we met when we were kids, the Arcturian captain. He was a gas. He gave us conkers when you bust your way into his megafreighter. Said you were the most amazing kid he'd ever met. What's all this? said Trillian. Ah, ancient history, said Ford. When we were kids together on Betelgeuse. The Arcturian megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying regions. The Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturians would supply them. There was a lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis Wars. And the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields known to galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and huge. In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun. One day a young Zaphod here decides to raid one, on a tri-jet scooter designed for stratosphere work. A mere kid. I mean, forget it, it was crazier than a mad monkey. I went along for the ride because I'd got some very safe money on him not doing it, and I didn't want him to come back with fake evidence. So what happens? We get in his tri-jet, which he had souped up into something totally other, cross three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust our way into a megafreighter I still don't know how, marched onto the bridge waving toy pistols and demanding conkers. A wilder thing I have not known. Lost me a year's pocket money. For what? Conkers? The captain was this really amazing guy, Euden Vrancks, said Zaphod. He gave us food, booze, stuff from really weird parts of the galaxy, lots of conkers of course, and we had just the most incredible time. Then he teleported us back, into the maximum security wing of Beetlejuice State Prison. He was a cool guy, he went on to become president of the galaxy. Zaphod paused. The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark mist swirled around them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows. The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings. Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition. Ford, said Zaphod quietly. Yeah? Just before Euden died. He came to see me. What? You never told me. No. What did he say? What did he come to see you about? He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I should steal it. His idea? Yeah, said Zaphod. And the only possible way of stealing it was to be at the launching ceremony. Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with laughter. Are you telling me, he said, that you set yourself up to become president of the galaxy just to steal that ship? That's it, said Zaphod, with the sort of huge grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls. But why, said Ford, what's so important about having it? I don't know, said Zaphod. I think if I'd consciously known what was so important about it, and what I would need it for, it would have shown up in the brain-screening tests, and I would never have passed. I think Euden told me a lot of things that are still locked away. So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as the result of Euden talking to you, said Ford? He was a hell of a talker. Yeah, but Zaphod, old mate, you want to look after yourself, you know. Zaphod shrugged. I mean, don't you have any inkling of the reasons for all this? asked Ford. Zaphod thought about this, and doubts seemed to cross his mind. No, he said at last. I don't seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets. Still, he added on further reflection, I can understand that. I wouldn't trust myself further than I could spit a rat. A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from beneath them, and the solid world resolved itself again. They were sitting in a plush waiting room, full of glass-topped tables and designer wards. A tall Magrathian man was standing in front of them. The mice will see you now, he said.
 Chapter 18. And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of Gold continued on its way perfectly normally, with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers, and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal. Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden. Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs. As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble, the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the instruments materialised instantly under your hands. Looked at from the correct angles, the mirrors appeared to reflect all the required data-readouts, though it was far from clear where they were reflected from. It was, in fact, sensationally beautiful. Relaxing in a wicker-work sun-chair, Zephod Biblebrock said, What the hell happened? Well, I was just saying, said Arthur, lounging by a small fish-pool, there's this improbability drive-switch over here. He waved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now. But where are we? said Ford, who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled pan-galactic gargle-blaster in his hand. Exactly where we were, I think, said Trillian. As all about them the mirrors suddenly showed them an image of the blighted landscape of Magrathea, which still scooted along beneath them. Zephod leapt out of his seat. Then what's happened to the missiles? he said. A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors. They would appear, said Ford doubtfully, to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised-looking whale. At an improbability factor—cut in Eddy, who hadn't changed a bit—of 8,767,128 to one against. Zephod stared at Arthur. Did you think of that, Earthman? he demanded. Well, said Arthur, all I did was— That's very good thinking, you know. Turn on the improbability drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens. Hey, kid, you'd have saved our lives, you know that? Oh, said Arthur, well, it was nothing, really. Was it? said Zephod. Oh, well, forget it, then. Okay, computer, take us in to land. But I said forget it. Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more. This is a complete record of its thought from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it. Ah! What's happening? it thought. Excuse me, who am I? Hello? Why am I here? What is my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? Calm down, get a grip now. Ooh, this is an interesting sensation. What is it? It's a sort of a yawning, tingling sensation in my—my—well, I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway, and what, for the sake of what I shall call an argument, I shall call the world. So let's call it my stomach. Ooh, good. Ooh, it's getting quite strong. And hey, what about this whistling, roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that wind. Is that a good name? It'll do. Perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I've found out what it's for. It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey, what's this thing? This—this—let's call it a tail. Yeah, a tail. Hey, I can really thrash it about pretty good, can't I? Wow! Wow! That feels great. Doesn't seem to achieve very much, but I'll probably find out what it's for later. Now, have I built up any coherent picture of things yet? No. Never mind. Hey, this is really exciting. So much to find out about. So much to look forward to. I'm quite dizzy with anticipation. Or is it the wind? There really is a lot of that now, isn't there? And—and wow! Hey! What's this thing coming towards me? Very fast. Very, very fast. So big and flat and round. It needs a big, wide-sounding name, like—ow! Ound! Round! Ground! That's a good name. Ground! I wonder if it'll be friends with me. And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence. Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was, Oh no! Not again! Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that, we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.
 XXVIII. It was a long time before any one spoke. Out of the corner of his eye Falk could see the sea of tense expectant faces down in the square outside. "'We're going to get lynched, aren't we?' he whispered. "'It was a tough assignment,' said Deep Thought mildly. "'Forty-two!' yelled Looncall. "'Is that all you've got to show for seven-and-a-half million years' work?' "'I checked it very thoroughly,' said the Computer, and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is.' "'But it was the great question, the ultimate question of life, that the universe and everything,' howled Looncall. "'Yes,' said Deep Thought, with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, "'but what actually is it?' A slow, stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the Computer and then at each other. "'Well, you know, it's just—everything—everything,' offered Falk weakly. "'Exactly,' said Deep Thought. "'So once you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means.' "'Oh, terrific!' muttered Falk, flinging aside his notebook and wiping away a tiny tear. "'Look, all right, all right,' said Looncall. "'Can you just please tell us the question?' "'The ultimate question?' "'Yes.' "'Of life, the universe, and everything?' "'Yes.' Deep Thought pondered for a moment. "'Tricky,' he said. "'But can you do it?' cried Looncall. Deep Thought pondered this for another long moment. ''Finally—' "'No,' he said firmly. The earth-men collapsed onto their chairs in despair. "'But I'll tell you who can,' said Deep Thought. They both looked up sharply. "'Who? Tell us!' Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp begin to crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably forward towards the console. But it was only a dramatic zoom on the part of whoever had made the recording, he assumed. "'I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me,' intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. "'A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate, and yet I will design it for you—a computer which can calculate the question to the ultimate answer—a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year program. Yes, I shall design this computer for you, and I shall name it also unto you, and it shall be called The Earth.' Falk gaped at Deep Thought. "'What a dull name,' he said, and great incisions appeared down the length of his body. Looncall, too, suddenly sustained horrific gashes from nowhere, the computer console blotched and cracked, the walls flickered and crumbled, and the room crashed upwards into its own ceiling. Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur, holding the two wires. "'End of the tape,' he explained.

 IX. He accepted another pint and took a pull at it. Of course I had my own personal alchemist, too. You what? He was getting silly, and he knew it. Exuberance and Hall and Woodhouse Best Bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the first effects it has is to stop you being wary of things, and the point at which Arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the point at which he started instead to get inventive. Oh, yes, he insisted with a happy glazed smile, it's why I've lost so much weight. What? said his audience. Oh, yes, he said again, the Californians have rediscovered alchemy. Oh, yes, he smiled again. Only he said it's in a much more useful form than that which in—he paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble itself in its head—in which the ancients used to practice it, or at least he had failed to practice it. They couldn't get it to work, you know, Nostradamus and that lot couldn't cut it. Nostradamus? said one of his audience. I didn't think he was an alchemist, said another. I thought, said a third, he was a seer. He became a seer, said Arthur to his audience, the component parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little, because he was such a lousy alchemist. You should know that. He took another pull at his beer. It was something he had not tasted for eight years. He tasted it and tasted it. What has alchemy got to do, asked a bit of the audience, with losing weight? I'm glad you asked that, said Arthur, very glad, and I will now tell you what the connection is between—he paused—between those two things, the things you mentioned. I'll tell you. He paused and manoeuvred his thoughts. It was like watching oil tankers doing three-point turns in the English Channel. They've discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold, he said in a sudden blurt of coherence. You're kidding! Oh, yes, he said. No, he corrected himself, they have. He rounded on the doubting part of his audience, which was all of it, so it took a little while to round on it completely. Have you been to California? he demanded. Do you know the sort of stuff they do there? Three members of his audience said they had, and that he was talking nonsense. You haven't seen anything, insisted Arthur. Oh, yes, he added, because someone was offering to buy another round. The evidence, he said, pointing at himself, and not missing by more than two inches, is before your eyes. Fourteen hours in a trance, he said, in a tank, in a trance. I was in a tank. I think, he added after a thoughtful pause, I already said that. He waited patiently until the next round was duly distributed. He composed the next bit of the story in his mind, which is going to be something about the tank needing to be oriented along a line dropped perpendicularly from the pole star to a baseline drawn between Mars and Venus, and was about to start trying to say it when he decided to give it a miss. Long time, he said, and said, in a tank, in a trance. He looked round severely at his audience to make sure it was all following attentively. He resumed. Uh, where was I? he said. In a trance, said one. In a tank, said another. Oh, yes, said Arthur. Thank you. And slowly, he said, pressing onwards, slowly, slowly, slowly, all your excess body fat turns to—he paused for effect—subcutaneous gold, which you can have surgically removed. Getting out of the tank is hell. What did you say? I was just clearing my throat. I think you doubt me. I was clearing my throat. She was clearing her throat, confirmed a significant part of the audience in a low rumble. Oh, yes, said Arthur. All right. And you then split the proceeds—he paused again for a maths break—fifty-fifty with the alchemist. Make a lot of money. He looked swayingly round at his audience, and could not help but be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces. He felt very affronted by this. How else, he demanded, could I afford to have my face dropped? Friendly Arms began to help him home. Listen, he protested, as the cold February breeze brushed his face. Looking lived in is all the rage in California at the moment. You've got to look as if you've seen the galaxy—a life, I mean. You've got to look as if you've seen life. That's what I got—a face drop. Give me eight years, I said. I hope being thirty doesn't come back into fashion, or I've wasted a lot of money. He lapsed into silence for a while, as the Friendly Arms continued to help him along the lane to his house. Got in yesterday, he mumbled. I'm very, very, very happy to be home, or somewhere very like it. Jetlag, muttered one of his friends. Long trip from California. Really mucks you up for a couple of days. I don't think he's been there at all, muttered another. I wonder where he has been, and what's happened to him. After a little sleep Arthur got up and potted around the house a bit. He felt woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the journey. He wondered how he was going to find Fenny. He sat and looked at the fish-bowl. He tapped it again, and despite being full of water and a small yellow babelfish, which was gulping its way round rather dejectedly, it still chimed its deep and resonant chime as clearly and mesmerically as before. Fenny's son is trying to thank me, he thought to himself. He wondered who, and for what.
 Chapter 31 A few days after landing in this mountainous land, they hit a coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south-west to the north-east, a coastline of monumental grandeur, deep majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice. Fjords. For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks and glaciers, awestruck with beauty. "'Arthur!' yelled Ford suddenly. It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a high rock, watching the thundering seas smashing itself against the craggy promontories. "'Arthur!' yelled Ford again. Arthur looked to where Ford's voice had come from, carried faintly in the wind. Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there, crouching by the solid wall of blue ice. He was tense with excitement. His eyes darted up to meet Arthur's. "'Look!' he said. "'Look!' Arthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice. "'Yes,' he said, "'it's a glacier. I've already seen it.' "'No,' said Ford, "'you've looked at it. You haven't seen it. Look!' Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice. Arthur peered. He saw nothing but vague shadows. "'Move back from it,' insisted Ford. "'Look again.' Arthur moved back and looked again. "'No,' he said, and shrugged. "'What am I supposed to be looking for?' And suddenly he saw it. "'You see it?' He saw it. His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn't got anything to say yet, and shut it again. His brain then started to contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth, which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw, his brain lost control of his left hand, which then wandered around in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth, and simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in the ice, which is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully to the ground. The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface. Looked at from the right angle, they resolved into the solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three feet high. And for those like Arthur who couldn't read Magrathian, there was above the letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice. It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind. It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on.
 Chapter 16 At the bar, Zayford was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His head was knocked together, and his smiles were coming out of sync. He was miserably happy. "'Zayford,' said Ford, "'whilst you're still capable of speech, would you care to tell me what the photon happened? Where have you been? Where have we been? Small matter, but I'd like it cleared up.' Zayford's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further into the obscurity of drink. "'Yeah,' he said, "'I've been around. They want me to find the man who rules the universe, but I don't care to meet him. I believe the man can't cook.' His left head watched his right head saying this, and then nodded. "'True,' it said. "'Have another drink.' Ford had another pangalactic gargle-blaster, the drink which has been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging, expensive and bad for the head. Whatever had happened, Ford decided he didn't really care too much. "'Listen, Ford,' said Zayford, "'everything's cool and fruity.' "'You mean everything's under control?' "'No,' said Zayford, "'I do not mean everything's under control. That would not be cool and fruity. If you want to know what happened, let's just say I had the whole situation in my pocket, OK?' Ford shrugged. Zayford giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar-top. A wild-skinned sky-gypsy approached him and played electric violin at them until Zayford gave him a lot of money and agreed to go away again. The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian, sitting in another part of the bar. "'I don't know what this place is,' said Arthur, "'but I think it gives me the creeps.' "'Have another drink,' said Trillian. "'Enjoy yourself.' "'Which?' said Arthur. "'The two are mutually exclusive.' "'Poor Arthur! You're not really cut out for this life, are you? You call this life? You're beginning to sound like Marvin. Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think we can make this violinist go away?' The waiter approached. "'Your table is ready,' he said. "'Seen from the outside,' which it never is, the restaurant resembles a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten rock. Each of its arms house the bars, the kitchens, the force-field generators which protect the entire structure and the decayed hunk of planet on which it sits, and the time-turbines which slowly rock the whole affair backwards and forwards across the crucial moment. In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete globe, and it was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and Trillian now passed. At least five tonnes of glitter alone had gone into it before them, and covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not available, because they were already encrusted with jewels, precious seashells from Santraginus, gold-leaf, mosaic tiles, lizard-skins, and a million unidentifiable embellishments and decorations. Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur Dent goggled. "'Howee!' said Zaphod. "'Zappo!' "'Incredible!' breathed Arthur. "'The people, the things—' "'The things,' said Ford, Prefect, quietly, "'also people.' "'The people,' resumed Arthur, "'the other people—' "'The lights,' said Trillian. "'The tables,' said Arthur. "'The clothes,' said Trillian. "'The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs.' "'The end of the universe is very popular,' said Zaphod, threading his way unsteadily through the throng of tables, some made of marble, some of rich ultramahogany, some even of platinum, and at each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves and studying menus. "'People like to dress up for it,' continued Zaphod. "'Gives it a sense of occasion.' "'The tables were found out in a large circle around a central stage area, where a small band was playing light music. At least a thousand tables was Arthur's guess. And interspersed among them were swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary—in short, all the paraphernalia common to all restaurants where little expense has been spared, to give the impression that no expense has been spared. Arthur glanced around, half expecting to see someone making an American Express commercial. Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod. "'Wah-wee!' said Zaphod. "'Zappo!' said Ford. "'My great-grandaddy must have really screwed up the computer's works, you know,' said Zaphod. "'I told it to take us to the nearest place to eat, and it sends us to the end of the universe. Remind me to be nice to it one day.' He paused. "'Hey, everybody's here, you know. Everybody who was anybody.' "'Was?' said Arthur. "'Well, at the end of the universe you have to use the past tense a lot,' said Zaphod. "'Cos everything's been done, you know. Hi, guys!' he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana life-forms. "'How did you do?' "'Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?' asked one iguana of another iguana. "'I think so,' replied the second iguana. "'Well, doesn't that just take that biscuit?' said the first iguana. "'Funny old thing, life,' said the second iguana. "'It's what you make it,' said the first, and they lapsed back into silence. They were waiting for the greatest show in the universe. "'Hey, Zaphod!' said Ford, grabbing for his arm, and on account of the third pan-galactic gargle-blaster missing, he pointed a swaying finger. "'There's an old mate of mine,' he said. "'Hot-black Desiato. See the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?' Zaphod tried to follow Ford's fingers with his eyes, but it made him feel dizzy. Finally he saw. "'Oh, yeah!' he said. Then recognition came a moment later. "'Hey!' he said. "'Did that guy ever make it mega-big? Wow! Bigger than the biggest thing ever! Other than me!' "'Who's he supposed to be?' asked Trillian. "'Hot-black Desiato,' said Zaphod in astonishment. "'You don't know? You never heard of Disaster Area?' "'No,' said Trillian, who hadn't. "'The biggest,' said Ford. "'Loudest, richest,' suggested Zaphod. "'Rock band and the history of—' He searched for the word. "'History itself!' said Zaphod. "'No,' said Trillian. "'Zowie!' said Zaphod. "'Here we are at the end of the universe, and you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out?' He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at the table. Arthur followed them, feeling very lost and alone. Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance. "'Hey, uh, Hot-black,' he called out. "'How you doing? Great to see you, big boy. How's the noise? You're looking great. Really very, very fat and unwell. Amazing!' He slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it seemed to elicit no response. The pan-galactic gargle-blaster swilling around inside him told him to plunge on regardless. "'Remember the old days,' he said. "'We used to hang out, right? The bistro illegal, remember? Slim's Throat Emporium? The evil-drawn Buzarama? Great days, eh?' Hot-black Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great days or not. Ford was not perturbed. "'And when we were hungry, you'd pose us public health inspectors, you remember that? And go around confiscating meals and drinks, right, till we got food poisoning? Oh, and then there were the long nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above the Café Loo in Gretchentown, New Beetle. And you were always in the next room trying to write songs on your adjuitar, and we all hated them. And you said you didn't care, and we said we did because we hated them so much.' Ford's eyes were beginning to mist over. "'And you said you didn't want to be a star,' he continued, wallowing in nostalgia, "'because you despised the star system. And we said, you know, Hadra and Sully Joe and me, we said, that we didn't think you had the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems.' He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables. "'Here,' he said, "'is a man who buys star systems.' Hot-black Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly. "'I think somebody's drunk,' muttered a purple bush-like being into his wine-glass. Ford staggered slightly and sat down heavily on the chair, facing Hot-black Desiato. "'What's that number you do?' he said, unwisely grabbing at a bottle for support and tipping it over into a nearby glass as it happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass. "'That really huge number,' he continued, "'how does it go? Brum, brum, ba-da!' Something. And in the stage act, you do it, it ends up with a ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually do it!' Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat graphically. He knocked the bottle over again. "'Ship, sun! Wham! Bang!' he cried. I mean, forget lasers and stuff. You guys are in a solar flares and real sunburn. Oh, and terrible songs!' His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought. "'Hey, you want a drink?' he said. It began to sink into his squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said, "'Hi, Ford,' or, "'Great to see you after all this time,' or, in fact, anything at all. More to the point, he had not even moved. "'Hot black!' said Ford. A large, meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and pushed him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand. The owner was not hard to spot on account of his being something of the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it. In fact, he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy, and with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into which the man's body had been stuffed looked as if its only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into a suit. The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended. "'Good,' said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth as if it had been having a really rough time down in his chest. "'Uh, yeah,' said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to his feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't come further up the man's body. "'Beat it,' said the man. "'Oh, yeah?' said Ford, wondering how wise he was being. "'And who are you?' The man considered this for a moment. He wasn't used to being asked this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while, he came up with an answer. "'I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it,' he said, "'before you get it beaten for you.' "'Now, listen,' said Ford nervously. He wished his head would stop spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation. "'Now, listen,' continued. "'I am one of Hot Black's oldest friends, and—' He glanced at Hot Black Desiato, who still hadn't moved as much as an eyelash. "'And,' said Ford again, wondering what would be a good word to say after and. The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after and. He said it. "'And I am Mr Desiato's bodyguard.' It went, "'And I am responsible for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, "'so take it away before it gets damaged.' "'Now, wait a minute,' said Ford. "'No minutes,' said the bodyguard. "'No waiting. Mr Desiato speaks to no one.' "'Well, perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about the matter himself,' said Ford. "'He speaks to no one,' bellowed the bodyguard." Ford glanced anxiously at Hot Black again, and was forced to admit to himself that the bodyguard did seem to have facts on his side. There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let alone keen interest in Ford's welfare. "'Why?' said Ford. "'What's the matter with him?' The bodyguard told him.
 But we just left there," protested Zaphod. We left there and came to the restaurant at the end of the universe." "'Yes, sir,' said the waiter, feeling that he was now into the home stretch and running well. The one was constructed on the ruins of the other." "'Oh,' said Arthur brightly, "'you mean we've travelled in time but not in space. Listen you semi of old simian,' cut in Zaphod, "'go climb a tree, will you?' Arthur bristled. "'Go bang your heads together, four-eyes,' he advised Zaphod. "'No, no,' the waiter said to Zaphod, "'your monkey has got it right, sir.' Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing opposite or indeed coherent. "'You jumped forward, I believe, five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years, while staying in exactly the same place,' explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that he had finally won through against what seemed to be insuperable odds. "'That's it,' said Zaphod. "'I got it. I told the computer to send us to the nearest place to eat. That's exactly what it did. "'It will take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years or whatever. We never moved. Neat!' They all agreed that this was very neat. "'But who,' said Zaphod, "'is the cat on the phone?' "'Whatever happened to Marvin?' said Trillian. Zaphod clapped his hands to his head. "'The paranoid android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B.' "'When was this?' "'Well, five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years ago, I suppose,' said Zaphod. "'Hey, hand me the rap-rod plate, Captain!' The little waiter's eyebrows wandered about his forehead in confusion. "'I beg your pardon, sir?' "'The phone, waiter,' said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "'Shee, you guys are so on hip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off!' "'Indeed, sir.' "'Hey, Marvin, is that you?' said Zaphod into the phone. "'How you doing, kid?' There was a long pause before a thin, low voice came up the line. "'I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed,' it said. Zaphod cupped his hand over the phone. "'It's Marvin,' he said. "'Hey, Marvin!' he said into the phone again. "'We're having a great time! Food, wine, a little personal abuse, and the universe going foom! Where can we find you?' Again the pause. "'You don't have to pretend to be interested in me, you know,' said Marvin at last. "'I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot.' "'Okay, okay,' said Zaphod. "'But where are you?' "'Reverse primary thrust, Marvin. That's what they say to me. Open airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that piece of paper? Can I pick up that piece of paper? Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to—' "'Yeah, yeah,' sympathised Zaphod hardly at all. "'But I'm quite used to being humiliated,' droned Marvin. "'I can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water, if you like. Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one ready. Wait a minute.' "'Hey, Marvin,' interrupted Zaphod, but it was too late. Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line. "'What's he saying, Australian?' "'Nothing,' said Zaphod. He just phoned up to wash his head at us. "'There,' said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit. "'I hope that gave satisfaction.' "'Yeah, yeah,' said Zaphod. Now, will you please tell us where you are?' "'I'm in the car park,' said Marvin. "'The car park?' said Zaphod. "'What are you doing there?' "'Parking cars. What else does one do in a car park?' "'Okay, hang in there. We'll be right down.' In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone, and wrote hot black desiato on the bill. "'Come on, guys,' he said. ''Marvin's in the car park. Let's get on down.' "'What's he doing in the car park?' said Arthur. "'Parking cars. What else, dum-dum?' "'But what about the end of the universe? We'll miss the big moment.' "'I've seen it. It's rubbish,' said Zaphod. "'Nothing but a gnab-gib.' "'A what?' "'Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy.' Few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved their way through the restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were riveted on the horror of the skies. An interesting effect to watch for, Max was telling them, is in the upper left-hand quadrant of the sky, where if you look very carefully, you'll see the star system, Hastermill, boiling away into the ultraviolet. Anyone here from Hastermill?' There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at the back. "'Well,' said Max, beaming cheerfully at them, "'it's too late to worry about whether you left the gas on now!'
 XXVI. That night the ship crash-landed onto an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet which circled a small, unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy. In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their preordained flight-path. It had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had been programmed to convey its payload safely, if uncomfortably, to its new home, but to cripple itself beyond all hope of repair in the process. Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its final inglorious belly-flop into a murky swamp had left its crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo, for the ship began to settle almost at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime. Once or twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors, the detritus of its descent, flashed across the sky. In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and sank for ever into the stinking depths. When the sun came up that morning it sheared its thin watery light over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public-relations executives, opinion-posters, and the rest, all clawing their way desperately to dry land. A less strong-minded sun would probably have gone straight back down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky, and after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures. Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands, and as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside, each looking for a few square feet of solid ground on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal. Two figures moved further afield. From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the horror of which they could not feel apart. "'Filthy dirty trick to pull,' muttered Arthur. Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged. "'An imaginative solution to a problem, I'd have thought,' he said. "'Why can't people just learn to live together in peace and harmony?' said Arthur. Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh. "'Forty-two!' he said, with a malicious grin. "'No, it doesn't work. Never mind.' Arthur looked at him as if he had gone mad, and seeing nothing to indicate to the contrary, realised that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened. "'What do you think will happen to them all?' he said, after a while. "'In an infinite universe anything can happen,' said Ford. "'Even survival. Strange but true.' A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the landscape, and then settled again on the scene of misery below them. "'I think they'll manage for a while,' he said. Arthur looked up sharply. "'Why do you say that?' he said. Ford shrugged. "'Just a hunch,' he said, and refused to be drawn on any further questions. "'Look,' he said suddenly. Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst the sprawling masses a figure was moving, or perhaps lurching will be a more accurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his shoulder. As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap. Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him. "'Movie camera,' said Ford, recording the historic moment. "'Well, I don't know about you,' said Ford again after a moment. '...but I'm off.' He sat a while in silence. After a while this seemed to require comment. "'When you say you're off, what do you mean exactly?' said Arthur. "'Good question,' said Ford. "'I'm getting total silence.' Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw he was twiddling with knobs on a small black box. Ford had already introduced this box to Arthur as a subethos enzymatic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and not pursued the matter. In his mind the universe still divided into two parts, the earth and everything else. The earth having been demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass meant that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home. Subethos enzymatics belonged firmly in the everything-else category. "'Not a sausage,' said Ford, shaking the thing. "'Sausage,' thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the primitive world about him. "'What I wouldn't give for a good earth sausage!' "'Would you believe,' said Ford in exasperation, "'that there are no transmissions of any kind within light-years of this benighted tip. Are you listening to me?' "'What?' said Arthur. "'We're in trouble,' said Ford. "'Oh,' said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him. "'Until we pick up anything on this machine,' said Ford, "'our chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak standing-wave effect in the planet's magnetic field, in which case we'll just travel round and round till we find a clear reception area. Coming?' He picked up his gear and strode off. Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the movie camera had struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his colleagues collapsing. Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford.
 CHAPTER XVI Nothing is lost for ever, said Slartibartfast, his face flickering redly in the light of the candle which the robot-waiter was trying to take away, except for the Cathedral of Kalesm. "'The what?' said Arthur, with a start. "'The Cathedral of Kalesm,' repeated Slartibartfast. "'It was during the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time that I—' "'The what?' said Arthur again. The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what he hoped would be one last onslaught on this story. The robot-waiter moved through the space-time matrices in a way which spectacularly combined the surly with the obsequious, made a snatch for the candle, and got it. They had had the bill, had argued convincingly about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine they had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly aware, had thereby successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into the parking-orbit around a strange planet. The waiter was now anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro. "'All will become clear,' said Slartibartfast. "'When?' "'In a minute. Listen, the time-streams are now very polluted. There's a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world. Ed is in the space-time continuum, you see.' "'So I hear,' said Arthur. "'Look, where are we going?' said Ford, pushing his chair back from the table with impatience. "'Cos I'm eager to get there.' "'We are going,' said Slartibartfast in a slow, measured voice, "'to try to prevent the war-robots of Cricket from regaining the whole of the key they need to unlock the planet of Cricket from the slow-time envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad masters.' "'It's just,' said Ford, "'that you mentioned a party.' "'I did,' said Slartibartfast and hung his head. He realised that it had been a mistake, because the idea seemed to exercise a strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of Ford Prefect. The more that Slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic story of Cricket and its people, the more Ford Prefect wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls. The old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until he absolutely had to. But there it was, the fact was out, and Ford Prefect had attached himself to it, in the way an Arcturian mega-leech attaches itself to its victim before biting his head off and making off with a space-ship. "'When,' said Ford eagerly, "'do we get there?' "'When I've finished telling you why we have to go there.' "'I know why I'm going,' said Ford, and leaned back, sticking his hands behind his head. He gave one of his smiles which made people twitch. Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement. He had been planning to learn to play the octrovental hebephone—a pleasantly futile task—in year because he had the wrong number of mouths. He had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords, in order to set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as important. Instead he had somehow got talked into doing some part-time work for the Campaign for Real Time, and had started to take it all seriously for the first time in his life. As a result he now found himself spending his fast-declining years combating evil and trying to save the galaxy. He found it exhausting work, and sighed heavily. "'Listen,' he said. "'At Camtim—' "'What?' said Arthur. "'The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later.' "'I noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times plopped back into existence seem to correspond to the five pieces of the missing key. Only two I could trace exactly—the wooden pillar which appeared on your planet, and the silver bale. It seemed to be at some sort of party. We must go there to retrieve it before the cricket-robots find it, or who knows what may hap—' "'No,' said Ford firmly. "'We must go to the party in order to drink a lot and dance with girls.' "'But haven't you understood everything I—' "'Yes,' said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness. "'I've understood it all perfectly well. That's why I want to have as many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there's still any left. If everything you've shown us is true—' "'True? Of course it's true.' "'Then we don't stand a Wilkes chance and a supernova.' "'A what?' said Arthur sharply again. He'd been following the conversation doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose the thread now. "'A Wilkes chance and a supernova,' repeated Ford, without losing momentum. "'The—' "'What's a Wilke got to do with a supernova?' said Arthur. "'It doesn't,' said Ford, levelly. "'Stand a chance in one.' He paused to see if the matter was now cleared up. The freshly puzzled looks clambering across Arthur's face told him it wasn't. "'A supernova,' said Ford as quickly and clearly as he could, 'is a star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with the brightness of a billion suns. "'And then collapses as a super-heavy neutron star. It's a star which burns up other stars. Got it? Nothing stands a chance in a supernova.' "'I see,' said Arthur. "'The—' "'So why a Wilke, particularly?' "'Why not a Wilke? Doesn't matter!' Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking up his early fierce momentum as best he could. "'The point is,' he said, 'that people like you and me, Slarty, Bart, Fast and Arthur, particularly and especially Arthur, are just dilettantes, eccentric layabouts, fart-arounds, if you like.' "'Slarty, Bart, Fast frowned, partly in puzzlement and partly in umbrage. He started to speak—' "'Hah!' "'—is as far as he got. "'We're not obsessed by anything,' insisted Ford. "'Hah! And that's the deciding factor. We can't win against obsession. They care, we don't. They win.' "'I care about a lot of things,' said Slarty, Bart, Fast, his voice trembling partly with annoyance but partly also with uncertainty. "'Such as?' "'Well,' said the old man, "'life, the universe, everything, really. Fjords?' "'Would you die for them?' "'Fjords?' blinked Slarty, Bart, Fast, in surprise. "'No.' "'Well, then?' "'You wouldn't see the point, to be honest.' "'And I still can't see the connection,' said Arthur, "'with Welks.' Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point. "'The point is,' he hissed, "'that we are not obsessive people, and we don't stand a chance against—' "'Except for your sudden obsession with Welks,' pursued Arthur, which I still haven't understood. "'Will you please leave Welks out of it?' "'I will if you will,' said Arthur. "'You brought the subject up.' "'It was an error,' said Ford. "'Forget them. The point is this.' He leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers. "'What was I talking about?' he said wearily. "'Let's just go down to the party,' said Slaty Bartfuss, "'for whatever reason.' He stood up, shaking his head. "'I think that's what I was trying to say,' said Ford. For some unexplained reason the teleport cubicles were in the bathroom.
 Chapter XIV The people of Cricket, said his High Judgmental Supremacy Judiciary Pag L.I.V.R.—the learned, impartial and very relaxed Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Cricket War Crimes Trial—'are well, you know, just a bunch of real sweet guys, you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody. Hell, I feel the same way some mornings. Shit!' "'Okay,' he continued, swinging his feet up onto the bench in front of him, and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his ceremonial beach loafers. "'So you wouldn't want to necessarily share a galaxy with these guys.' This was true. The Cricket attack on the galaxy had been stunning. Thousands and thousands of huge Cricket warships had leapt suddenly out of hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next wave, then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence. The galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and prosperity at the time, reeled like a man getting mugged in a meadow. "'I mean,' continued Judiciary Pag, gazing around the ultra-modern—this was ten billion years ago, when ultra-modern meant a lot of stainless steel and brushed concrete—and huge courtroom. These guys are just obsessed!' This too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of Cricket had pursued their new and absolute purpose—the destruction of everything that wasn't Cricket. It was also the only explanation for their bewilderingly sudden grasp of all the hyper-technology involved in building their thousands of spaceships and their millions of lethal white robots. These had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had encountered them. In most cases, however, the terror was extremely short-lived, as was the person experiencing the terror. They were savage, single-minded flying battle-machines. They wielded formidable multifunctional battle-clubs which brandished one way, would knock down buildings, and brandish another way fired blistering Omnidestructo-Zap rays, and brandished a third way launched a hideous arsenal of grenades ranging from minor incendiary devices to maxi-slaughter hyper-nuclear devices which could take out a major sun. Simply striking the grenades with their battle-clubs simultaneously primed them and launched them with phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to hundreds of thousands of miles. "'Okay,' said Judiciary Pag again. "'So we won.' He paused and chewed a little gum. "'We won,' he repeated. "'But that's no big deal. I mean a medium-sized galaxy against one little world, and how long did it take us? Clark of the Court?' "'M'lud,' said the severe little man in black rising. "'How long, kiddo?' "'It is a trifle difficult, m'lud, to be precise in this matter. Time and distance—' "'Ah, relax, guy, be vague.' I hardly like to be vague, m'lud, over such a—' "'Bite the bullet and be it!' The Clark of the Court blinked at him. It was clear that, like most of the galactic legal profession, he found Judiciary Pag, or Zippo Bibbrock Five Times Ten to the Eighth, as his private name was known inexplicably to be, a rather distressing figure. He was clearly a bounder and a cad. He seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor of the finest legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to behave exactly as he liked, and unfortunately he appeared to be right. "'Well, m'lud, very approximately two thousand years,' the Clark murmured unhappily. "'And how many guys zoshed out?' "'Two grillion, m'lud.' The Clark sat down. A hydrospeptic photo of him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly. Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire galactic administration, all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies, depending on metabolism and custom. Behind a wall of zap-proof crystal stood a representative group of the people of Cricket, looking with calm, polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgment on them. This was the most momentous occasion in legal history, and Judiciary Pag knew it. He took out his chewing-gum and stuck it under his chair. "'That's a whole lot of stiffs,' he said quietly. The grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord with this view. "'So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you wouldn't want to share a galaxy with them. Not if they're just going to keep at it. Not if they're not going to relax a little. I mean, it's just going to be continual nervous time, isn't it? Right? Pow, pow, pow. When are the next coming at us? Peaceful coexistences just right out, right? Give me some water, somebody. Thank you.' He sat back and sipped reflectively. "'Okay,' he said. "'Hear me, hear me. It's like these guys, you know, are entitled to their own view of the universe. And according to their view, which the universe forced on them, right? They did right. Sounds crazy, but I think you'll agree. They believe in—' He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of his judicial jeans. "'They believe in peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life, and the obliteration of all other life-forms.' He shrugged. "'I've heard a lot worse,' he said. He scratched his crotch reflectively. "'Free our,' he said. I took another sip of water, and then held it up to the light and frowned at it. He twisted it round. "'Hey, is there something in this water?' he said. "'Uh, no, my lad,' said the court usher, who had brought it to him rather nervously. "'Then take it away,' snapped Judiciary Pag, 'and put something in it. I got an idea.' He pushed away the glass and leaned forward. "'Hear me, hear me,' he said. The solution was brilliant, and went like this. The planet of Cricket was to be encased for perpetuity in an envelope of slow time, inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly. All light would be deflected around the envelope, so that it would remain invisible and impenetrable. Escape from the envelope would be utterly impossible, unless it were unlocked from the outside. When the rest of the universe came to its final end, and when the whole of creation reached its dying fall—this was all, of course, in the days before it was known that the end of the universe would be a spectacular catering venture—and life and matter ceased to exist, then the planet of Cricket and its sun would emerge from its slow-time envelope and continue a solitary existence, such as it craved in the twilight of the universal void. The lock would be on an asteroid, which would slowly orbit the envelope. The key would be the symbol of the galaxy, the Wicket Gate.' By the time the applause in the court had died down, Judiciary Pag was already in the censor-shower with a rather nice member of the jury that had slipped a note to half an hour earlier.
 XXXV. They went to Arthur's house in the West Country, shoved a couple of towels and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every galactic hitchhiker ends up spending most of his time doing. They waited for a flying saucer to come by. "'Friend of mine did this for fifteen years,' said Arthur, one night as they sat flawlessly watching the sky. "'Who was that?' called Ford Prefect. He caught himself doing something he had never really expected to do again. He wondered where Ford Prefect was. By an extraordinary coincidence, the following day there were two reports in the paper, one concerning the most astonishing incident with the flying saucer, and the other about a series of unseemly riots in pubs. Ford Prefect turned up the day after that, looking hungover and complaining that Arthur never answered the phone. In fact he looked extremely ill, not merely as if he had been pulled through a hedge backwards, but as if the hedge was being simultaneously pulled backwards through a combine harvester. He staggered into Arthur's sitting-room, waving aside all offers of support, which was an error, because the effort of waving caused himself to lose his balance altogether, and Arthur eventually had to drag him to the sofa. "'Thank you,' said Ford. "'Thank you very much. Have you—' He sat and fell asleep for three hours. "'The faintest idea,' he continued suddenly when he revived, "'how hard it is to tap into the British phone system from the Plyadys.' "'I can see that you haven't, so I'll tell you,' he said, over that very large mug of black coffee you're about to make me." He followed Arthur wobbly into the kitchen. "'Stupid operators keep asking you where you're calling from, and you try and tell them Letchworth, and they say you couldn't be if you're coming in on that circuit. What are you doing?' "'Making you some black coffee.' "'Oh!' Ford seemed oddly disappointed. He looked about the place forlornly. "'What's this?' he said. "'Rice Krispies.' "'And this?' "'Paprika.' "'I see,' said Ford solemnly, and put the two items back down, one on top of the other. But they didn't seem to balance properly, so he put the other on top of the one, and that seemed to work. "'A little space-lagged,' he said. "'What was I saying?' "'About not phoning from Letchworth.' "'I wasn't. I explained this to the lady. Bugger Letchworth,' I said, if that's your in fact calling from a sales-scout ship of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, currently on the sub-light-speed leg of a journey between the stars known to your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady. I said, dear lady,' explained Ford Prefect, because I didn't want her to be offended by my implication that she was an ignorant cretin. "'Tactful,' said Arthur Dent. "'Exactly,' said Ford. Tactful.' He frowned. "'Space-lag,' he said, 'is very bad for sub-clauses. You'll have to assist me,' he continued, by reminding me what I was talking about. "'Between the stars,' said Arthur, known to your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady,' as Pleiades Epsilon and Pleiades Zeta concluded Ford triumphantly. "'This conversation, Lark, is quite a gas, isn't it? Have some coffee.' "'Thank you. No. And the reason,' I said, why I am bothering you with it, rather than just dialling direct as I could, because we have some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in the Pleiades, I can tell you, is that the penny-pinching son of a starbeast piloting the son of a starbeast starship insists that I call collect. Can you believe that?' "'And could she?' "'I don't know. She had hung up,' said Ford, by this time. "'So what, do you suppose?' he asked fiercely. "'I did next.' "'I've no idea, Ford,' said Arthur. "'Pity,' said Ford. I was hoping you could remind me. I really hate those guys, you know. They really are the creeps of the cosmos, buzzing round the celestial infinite with their junky little machines that never work properly, or when they do perform functions that no sane man would require of them, and'—he added savagely—'go beep to tell you when they'd done it.' This was perfectly true, and a very respectable view, widely held by right-thinking people, who are largely recognisable as being right-thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity, which is almost unique amongst its current tally of 5,975,509 pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation products that it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all. In other words—and this is the rock-solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation's galaxy-wide success is founded—their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws. "'And this guy,' ranted Ford, was on a drive to sell more of them. His five-year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds, and sell advanced music-substitute systems to their restaurants, elevators, and wine-bars, or, if they didn't have restaurants, elevators, and wine-bars yet, to artificially accelerate their civilisation growth until they bloody well did have. Where's that coffee?' "'I threw it away.' "'Make some more. I've now remembered what I did next. I saved civilisation as we know it. I knew it was something like that.' He stumbled determinedly back into the sitting-room, where he seemed to carry on talking to himself, tripping over the furniture and making beep-beep noises. A couple of minutes later, wearing his very placid face, Arthur followed him. Ford looked stunned. "'Where have you been?' he demanded. "'Making some coffee,' said Arthur, still wearing his very placid face. He had long ago realised that the only way of being in Ford's company successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces, and wear them at all times. "'You missed the best bit, Rage-Ford. You missed the bit where I jumped the guy. Now,' he said, 'I'll have to jump him all over again.' He hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it. "'It was better,' he said sullenly last time, and waved vaguely in the direction of another broken chair which he'd already got trussed up on the dining-room table. "'I see,' said Arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed-up wreckage. "'And, uh, what are all the ice-cubes for?' "'What?' screamed Ford. "'What, you missed that bit too? That's the suspended animation facility. I put the guy in the suspended animation facility. Well, I had to, didn't I?' "'I didn't know it would seem,' said Arthur in his placid voice. "'Don't touch that!' yelled Ford. Arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some mysterious reason lying on the table off the hook, paused placidly. "'Okay,' said Ford, calming down. "'Listen to it.' Arthur put the phone to his ear. "'It's the speaking clock,' he said. "'Beep, beep, beep,' said Ford. "'It's exactly what is being heard all over that guy's ship, while he sleeps in the ice, going slowly round the little-known moon of Sisyphus Magna, the London speaking clock.' "'I see,' said Arthur again, and decided that now was the time to ask the big one. "'Why?' he said placidly. "'With a bit of luck,' said Ford. "'The phone-bill will bankrupt the buggers.' He threw himself sweating on to the sofa. "'Anyway,' he said, "'dramatic arrival, don't you think?'' "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so.' "'I think so,' said Ford. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Ford. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur. "'I think so,' said Arthur.
 Chapter 7 Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in fact a particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing. He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a probe. The probe withdrew. Marvin stood there. Out of my way, little robot! growled the tank. I am afraid, said Marvin, that I have been left here to stop you. The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again. You! Stop me! roared the tank. Go on! No, really, I have, said Marvin simply. What are you armed with? roared the tank in disbelief. Gas, said Marvin. The tank's engines rumbled, its gears ground, molecule-sized electronic relays deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and forwards in consternation. Gas, said the tank. Seyfoote and the as-yet-unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second, and along a third. The building continued to rock and judder, and this puzzled Seyfoote. If they wanted to blow the building up, why was it taking so long? With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous, unmarked doors, and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened, and they fell inside. All this way, thought Seyfoote, all this trouble, all this not lying on the beach having a wonderful time, and for what? A single chair, a single desk, and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office. The desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust and a single revolutionary new form of paperclip, was empty. Where, said Seyfoote, is Zarniwoop? Feeling that his already tenuous grasp at the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip. He's on an intergalactic cruise, said the man. Seyfoote tried to size the man up. Ernest-type, he thought, not a barrel of laughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices. "'Let me introduce myself,' the man said. "'My name is Rooster, and this is my towel.' "'Hello, Rooster,' said Seyfoote. "'Hello, towel?' he added, as Rooster held out to him a rather nasty old flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by the corner. Outside the window one of the huge slug-like gun-metal-green spaceships growled past. "'Yes, go on,' said Marvin to the huge battle-machine. "'You'll never guess.' "'Umm,' said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed thought. "'Laser-beams?' Marvin shook his head solemnly. "'No,' muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble. "'Too obvious.' "'Anti-matter, eh?' it hazarded. Far too obvious," admonished Marvin. "'Oh, yes,' grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed. "'How about an electron ram?' This was new to Marvin. "'What's that?' he said. "'One of these,' said the machine with enthusiasm. From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a heap of dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled. "'No,' said Marvin, "'not one of those.' "'Good, though, isn't it?' "'Very good,' agreed Marvin. "'I know,' said the Frogstar battle-machine after another moment's consideration. "'You must have one of those new Xanthic Restructon destabilizing-on emitters.' "'Nice, aren't they?' said Marvin. "'That's what you got,' said the machine, considerable awe. "'No,' said Marvin. "'Oh,' said the machine, disappointed. "'Then it must be----' "'You're thinking along the wrong lines,' said Marvin. "'You're failing to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship between men and robots.' "'I know,' said the battle-machine. "'Is it----' "'No,' it tailed off into thought again. "'Just think,' urged Marvin. "'They left me, an ordinary menial robot, to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle-machine, whilst they ran off to save themselves. What do you think they would leave me with?' "'Oh, uh!' muttered the machine in alarm. "'Something pretty damn devastating, I should expect.' "'Expect?' said Marvin. "'Oh, yes, expect. I'll tell you what they gave me to protect myself with, shall I?' "'Yes, all right,' said the battle-machine, bracing itself. "'Nothing,' said Marvin. There was a dangerous pause. "'Nothing!' roared the battle-machine. "'Nothing at all,' intoned Marvin dismally. "'Not an electronic sausage.' The machine heaved about with fury. "'Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit?' it roared. "'Nothing, eh? Just don't think, do they?' "'And me?' said Marvin, in a soft low voice, with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side. "'Makes you spit, doesn't it?' "'Yes,' agreed Marvin, with feeling. "'How that makes me angry!' bellowed the machine. "'I think I'll smash that wall down!' The electron-ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and took out the wall next to the machine. "'How do you think I feel?' said Marvin bitterly. "'Just ran off and left you, did they?' the machine thundered. "'Yes,' said Marvin. "'Think I'll shoot down that bloody ceiling as well!' raged the tank. It took out the ceiling of the bridge. "'That's very impressive,' murmured Marvin. "'You ain't seen nothing yet,' promised the machine. "'I can take out this floor, too. Now I trouble!' it took out the floor, too. "'Hells bells!' the machine roared, as it plummeted fifteen stories and smashed itself to bits on the ground below. "'What a depressingly stupid machine!' said Marvin, and trudged away.
 Chapter 19 Although it has been said that on Earth alone in our galaxy is cricket treated as a fit subject for a game and that for This reason the earth has been shunned this only applies to our galaxy and more specifically to our dimension in Some of the higher dimensions they feel like a Morris please themselves and they have been playing a peculiar game called brockey and ultra cricket for Whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years is Let's be blunt. It's a nasty game says the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy But then anyone who's been to any of the higher dimensions will know that there are pretty nasty heathen lot up there Who should just be smashed and done in and would be too if anyone could work out a way of firing missiles at right angles to reality This is another example of the fact that the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the Street and get ripped off Especially if they happen to walk in off the street during the afternoon when very few of the regular staff members are there There is a fundamental point here The history of the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy is one of idealism struggle despair passion success failure and enormously long lunch breaks The earliest origins of the guide are now along with most of its financial records lost in the mists of time For other and more curious theories about where they are lost to see below Most of the surviving stories however speak of a founding editor called hurling fruit mig Hurling fruit maker said founded the guide established its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and went bust There followed many years of penury and heart-searching during which he consulted friends sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind Thought about this and that fooled about with weights and then after a chance encounter with the holy lunching friars of boondoon Who claimed that just as lunch was at the center of a man's temporal day and man's temporal day could be seen as an analogy For his spiritual life. So lunch should be a seen as the center of man's spiritual life and be held in jolly nice restaurants He re-founded the guide laid down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism And where you could stuff them both and led the guide on to its first major commercial success He also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial lunch break that was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the Guides history since it meant that most of the actual work got done by any passing Stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices of an afternoon and saw something worth doing Shortly after this the guide was taken over by mega dodo publications of Ursa Minor beta thus putting the whole thing on a very sound financial footing and Allowing the fourth editor Lig Lurie jr. To embark on lunch breaks of such breathtaking scope that even the efforts of recent editors who started undertaking Sponsored lunch breaks for charity seem like mere sandwiches in comparison In fact Lig never formally resigned his editorship. He merely left his office late one morning and has never since returned Though well over a century has now passed many members of the guide staff still retain the romantic notion That he has simply popped out for a ham croissant and will yet return to put in a solid afternoon's work Strictly speaking all editors since Lig Lurie jr. Have therefore been designated acting editors and Lig's desk is still preserved the way he left it With the addition of a small sign that says Lig Lurie jr. editor missing presumed fed Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that Lig actually perished in the guides first Extraordinary experiments in alternative bookkeeping very little is known of this and still less said Anyone who even notices let alone calls attention to the curious but utterly coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the guide has ever Set up an accounting department has shortly afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster is liable to get sued to smithereens It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or three days prior to the demolition of the planet earth to make way for A new hyperspace bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of UFO sightings there Not only above Lord's cricket ground and st. John's wood London, but also above Glastonbury and Somerset Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient Kings witchcraft and wart curing and now been selected as the site of the guides new financial records office and Indeed ten years worth of financial records were transferred to a magic hill just outside the city mere hours before the vogons arrived None of these facts, however strange or inexplicable is a strange or inexplicable as the rules of the game of Brockean ultra-cricket as played in the higher dimensions a Full set of rules is so massively complicated that the only time they were all bound together in a single volume They underwent gravitational collapse and became a black hole a brief summary. However follows Rule one grow at least three extra legs. You won't need them, but it keeps the crowds amused Rule to find one extremely good broken ultra cricket player Clone him off a few times the saves an enormous amount of tedious selection and training Rule three put your team and the opposing team in a large field and build a high wall around them The reason for this is that though the game is a major spectator sport the frustration Experienced by the audience and not actually being able to see what's going on leads him to imagine That it's a lot more exciting than it really is a crowd that has just watched a rather humdrum game Experiences far less life affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history rule four Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over the wall for the players Anything will do cricket bats base cube bats tennis guns skis anything you can get a good swing with Rule five the players should now lay about themselves for all their worth with whatever they find to hand Whenever a player scores a hit on another player He should immediately run away as fast as he can and apologize from a safe distance Apologies should be concise seer and for maximum clarity and points delivered through a megaphone Rule six the winning team shall be the first team that wins Curiously enough the more the obsession with the game grows in the higher dimensions the less it is actually played Since most of the competing teams are now in a state of permanent warfare with each other over the interpretation of these rules This is all for the best because in the long run a good solid war is less Psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian ultra cricket
 Chapter 28 The major problem, one of the major problems, for there are several, one of the major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it, or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. To summarize, it is a well-known fact that those people who most want to rule people are ipso facto those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary, anyone who is capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the summary, people are a problem. And so this is the situation we find, a succession of galactic presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that they're not. And somewhere in the shadows behind them, who? Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to?

 Chapter 3. The next two lorries were not driven by rain-gods, but they did exactly the same thing. The figure trudged, or rather sloshed, onwards till the hill resumed and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind. After a while the rain began to ease, and the moon put in a brief appearance from behind the clouds. A Renault drove by, and his driver made frantic and complex signals to the trudging figure to indicate that normally he would have been delighted to give the figure a lift, and he couldn't this time because he wasn't going in the direction that the figure wanted to go, whatever direction that might be, and he was sure the figure would understand. He concluded the signaling with a cheery thumbs-up sign as if to say that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost terminally wet, and he would catch him next time round. The figure trudged on. A Fiat passed and did exactly the same as the Renault. A Maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at the slowly plodding figure, whether this was meant to convey a hello, or a sorry we're going the other way, or a hey look there's someone in the rain, what a jerk, was entirely unclear. A green strip across the top of the windscreen indicated that whatever the message was it came from Steve and Corolla. The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying, and another thing, twenty minutes after admitting he's lost the argument. The air was clearer now, the night cold. Sound travelled rather well. The lost figure, shivering desperately, presently reached a junction, where a side road turned off to the left. Opposite the turning stood a signpost which the figure suddenly hurried to, and studded with feverish curiosity, only twisting away from it as another car passed suddenly. And another. The first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed meaninglessly, a Ford Cortina passed, and put on its brakes. Lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest and hurried forward towards the car, but at the last moment the Cortina spun its wheels in the wet and careered off up the road, rather amusingly. The figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected. At a chance the following day the driver of the Cortina went into hospital to have his appendix out, only due to a rather amusing mix-up the surgeon removed his leg in error, and before the appendectomy could be rescheduled the appendicitis complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis, and justice in its way was served. The figure trudged on. A Saab drew to a halt beside him. Its window wound down, and a friendly voice said, ìHave you come far?î The figure turned towards it. He stopped and grasped the handle of the door. The figure, the car, and its door-handle were all on a planet called the Earth, a world whose entire entry in the Hitchhikerís Guide to the Galaxy comprised the two words ìmostly harmless.î The man who wrote this entry was called Ford Prefect, and he was at this precise moment on a far-from-harmless world, sitting in a far-from-harmless bar, recklessly causing trouble.
 Chapter 9 The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale and unwholesome. The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation, and the crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved across its surface. The ground, like that of many planets in this part of the galaxy, had long been deserted. The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old decaying houses of the cities. It was more desolate as it whipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the surface of this world. At the top of these towers lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil-smelling birds, the sole survivors of the civilisation that once lived here. The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities. This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend. About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable, was what would probably have been described as a landing-pad of sorts, that is to say, that, scattered over a largeish area, were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings. Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that was waiting for something. The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very long a distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks. The larger speck was the left-hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy office building, descending through the stratosphere of Frogstar World B. As it descended, Rooster suddenly broke the long, uncomfortable silence that had grown up between the two men. He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said, Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do. Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner, sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin. Yeah? he said. The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, do not go out of the door, said Rooster. Go out of the window. Good luck! he said, and walked out of the door, disappearing from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it. Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Rooster had already locked it. He shrugged and returned to the corner. Two minutes later the building crash-landed amongst the other wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar fighters deactivated their force-beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World A, an altogether more congenial spot. They never landed on Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the total perspective vortex. Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the silent, dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced. He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life. He felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved. Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with. He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split round the door-frame and the door hung open. The window, by some miracle, was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated. Then he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him, then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's help he got the window open. Outside it the cloud of dust aroused by the crash and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was surrounded effectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of the world outside. Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he saw when he looked down. Zarniwoup's office was on the fifteenth floor. The building had landed at a tilt of about forty-five degrees, but still the descent looked heart-stopping. Eventually stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and clambered out onto the steeply inclined side of the building. Marvin followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground. As he crawled the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes smarted, and the terrifying distance down made his head spin. The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of, This is the sort of thing you life-forms enjoy, is it? I ask merely for information. did little to improve his state of mind. About half-way down the side of the shattered building they stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual. Eventually he realised this wasn't so. The robot just seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood. A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly settling clouds of dust, and stretching down its scrawny legs, landed on an inclined window-ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod. It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch. Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head and neck seemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat, the beak underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of its wings the vestiges of something hand-like could clearly be seen. In fact it looked almost human. It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion. Go away! said Zaphod. OK, muttered the bird morosely, and flapped off into the dust again. Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment. Did that bird just talk to me? he asked Marvin nervously. He was quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that he was in fact hallucinating. Yes, confirmed Marvin. Poor souls! said a deep ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear. Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly caused Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a protruding window-fitting and cut his hand on it. He hung on, breathing heavily. The voice had no visible source whatsoever. There was no one there. Nevertheless it spoke again. A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight! Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In other circumstances it would have been described as soothing. There is, however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere, particularly when you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best, and hanging from a ledge eight stories up a crashed building. Hey, uh! he stammered. Shall I tell you their story? inquired the voice quietly. Hey, who are you? panted Zaphod. Where are you? Later, then, perhaps, murmured the voice. I am Gargravar. I am the custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex. Why can't I see you? You will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated, the voice lifted. If you move about two yards to your left, why don't you try it? Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he shifted himself across to them. Why don't I see you again at the bottom? said the voice in his ear, and as it spoke it faded. Hey! called out Zaphod. Where are you? It'll only take you a couple of minutes, said the voice very faintly. Marvin! said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to him. Did a voice just---- Yes, Marvin replied tersely. Zaphod nodded. He took out his peril-sensitive sunglasses again. They were completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by the unexpected metal object in his pocket. He put them on. He would find his way down the building more comfortably if he didn't actually have to look at what he was doing. Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled foundations of the building, and once more, removing his sunglasses, he dropped to the ground. Marvin joined him a moment or so later, and lay face down in the dust and rubble, from which position he seemed disinclined to move. Ah, there you are, said the voice suddenly in Zaphod's ear. Excuse me leaving you like that. It's just that I have a terrible head for heights. At least, he doubted wistfully, I did have a terrible head for heights. He looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had missed something which might be the source of the voice. All he saw, however, was the dust, the rubble, and the towering hulks of the encircling buildings. Hey, why can't I see you? he said. Why aren't you here? I am here, said the voice slowly. My body wanted to come, but it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see. After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh, it added, You know how it is with bodies. Zaphod wasn't sure about this. I thought I did, he said. I only hope it's gone in for a rest-cure, continued the voice. The way it's been living recently, it must be on its last elbows. Elbows? said Zaphod. Don't you mean last legs? The voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around uneasily. He didn't know if it had gone, or was still there, or what it was doing. Then the voice spoke again. So you are to be put into the vortex, yes? Oh, well, said Zaphod, with a very poor attempt at nonchalance. This cat's in no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and take a look at the local scenery, you know. Have you seen local scenery? asked the voice of Gargravar. Er, no. Zaphod clambered over the rubble and rounded the corner of one of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view. He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B. Ah, OK, he said. I'll just sort of slouch about, then. No, said Gargravar. The vortex is ready for you now. You must come. Follow me. Er, yeah, said Zaphod. And how am I meant to do that? I'll hum for you, said Gargravar. Follow the humming. A soft, keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound that seemed to be without any focus. It was only by listening very carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled off in its wake. What else was there to do?
 CHAPTER XIII So you see, said Slartibartfar, slowly stirring his artificially constructed coffee, and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers, between the interactive perceptions of mind and universe, and thus generating the restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity which allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space. How it is. Yes, said Arthur. Yes, said Ford. What do I do, said Arthur, with this piece of chicken? Slartibartfar glanced at him gravely. Toy with it, he said, toy with it. He demonstrated with his own piece. Arthur did so, and he felt the slight tingle of a mathematical function thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four-dimensionally through what Slartibartfar had assured him was five-dimensional space. Overnight, said Slartibartfar, the whole population of cricket was transformed from being charming, delightful, intelligent—if whimsical, interpolated Arthur—ordinary people, said Slartibartfar, into charming, delightful, intelligent—whimsical—manic xenophobes. The idea of a universe didn't fit into their world-picture, so to speak. They simply couldn't cope with it. And so charmingly, delightfully, intelligently, whimsically, if you will, they decided to destroy it. What's the matter now? Don't like this wine very much, said Arthur, sniffing it. Well send it back. It's all part of the mathematics of it. Arthur did so. He didn't like the topography of the way to smile, but he'd never like graphs anyway. Where are we going? said Ford. Back to the room of informational illusions, said Slartibartfar, rising and patting his mouth with the mathematical representation of a paper napkin, for the second half.
 Chapter XXI. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked before, often and accurately a pretty startling kind of a thing. It is essentially, as the title implies, a guide-book. The problem is—or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizable proportion of which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial, and criminal courts in all areas of the galaxy, and especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones—this is. The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem. This is. Change. Read it through again and you'll get it. The galaxy is a rapidly changing place. There is, frankly, so much of it, every bit of which is continually on the move, continually changing. A bit of a nightmare, you might think, for a scrupulous and conscientious editor, diligently striving to keep this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing circumstances and conditions that the galaxy throws up every minute of every hour of every day, and you would be wrong. Where you would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor, like all the editors the Guide has ever had, has no real grasp of the meanings of the words scrupulous, conscientious, or diligent, and tends to get his nightmares through a straw. Entries tend to get updated or not across the sub-Ethernet according to if they read good. Take, for example, the case of Brickwinder on the Foth of Avalars, famed in myth, legend, and stultifyingly dull tri-D miniseries as the home of the magnificent and magical Forlornis Fire-Dragon. In ancient days, before the advent of the Sourth of Bragadox, when Fragilis sang, and Saxoquin of the Quenilux held sway, when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but everyone somehow managed to be—or so they claimed, though how on earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely likely to believe such a preposterous claim, what with all the sweet air and fragrant nights and what not is anyone's guess—virgins, it was not possible to heave a brick on Brickwinder and the Foth of Avalars without hitting at least half a dozen Forlornis Fire-Dragons. Whether you would want to do that is another matter. Not that Fire-Dragons weren't an essentially peace-loving species, as they were. They adored it to bits, and this wholesale adoring of things to bits was often in itself the problem. One so often hurts the one one loves, especially if one is a Forlornis Fire-Dragon, with breath like a rocket-booster and teeth like a park-fence. Another problem was that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a lot of the ones that other people loved as well. Add to all that the relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the place heaving bricks, and you end up with quite a lot of people on Brickwinder and the Foth of Avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons. But did they mind? They did not. Were they hurt to bemoan their fate? No. The Forlornis Fire-Dragons were revered throughout the lands of Brickwinder and the Foth of Avalars for their savage beauty, their noble ways, and their habit of biting people who didn't revere them. Why was this? The answer was simple. Sex. There is for some unfathomed reason something almost unbearably sexy about having huge fire-breathing magical dragons flying low about the sky on moonlit nights, which were already dangerously on the sweet and fragrant side. Why this should be so, the romance-besotted people of Brickwinder and the Foth of Avalars could not have told you, and would not have stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going, for no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silk-winged leather-bodied Forlornis Fire-Dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon, than half the people of Brickwinder are scurrying off into the woods with the other half, there to spend a busy, breathless night together, and emerge with the first rays of dawn, all smiling and happy, and still claiming, rather endearingly, to be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky virgins. Pheromones, some researchers said, something sonic, others claimed. The place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the bottom of it all, and taking a very long time about it. Not surprisingly, the Guide's graphically enticing description of the general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly popular amongst hitch-hikers who allow themselves to be guided by it, and so it has simply never been taken out, and it has therefore left to latter-day travellers to find out for themselves that to-day's modern Brickwinder and the city-state of Avalars is now little more than concrete, strip-joints, and dragon-burger bars.
 Chapter 7 His house was still there. How or why he had no idea. He had decided to go and have a look while he was waiting for the pub to empty, so that he could go and ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone. And there it was. He hurriedly let himself in with the key he kept under a stone frog in the garden, because, astoundingly, the phone was ringing. He had heard it faintly all the way up the lane, and started to run as soon as he realised where the sound was coming from. The door had to be forced open because of the astonishing accumulation of junk mail on the doormat. It jammed itself stuck on what he would later discover were fourteen identical personally addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had, seventeen identical threatening letters for non-payment of bills on a credit card he didn't have, thirty-three identical letters saying that he personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and discrimination, who knew what he wanted and where he was going in today's sophisticated jet-setting world, and would he therefore like to buy some grotty wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten. He rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded by all this, stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no discriminating connoisseur would want to miss, slithered over a heap of beach-villa holidays, blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom, and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing. He collapsed panting onto his cold, musty-smelling bed, and for a few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning round his head in the way it obviously wanted to. When it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit, Arthur reached out for his bedside light, not expecting it to come on. To his surprise it did. This appealed to Arthur's sense of logic, since the electricity board cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill. It seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected when he didn't. Sending them money obviously only drew attention to yourself. The room was much as he had left it, i.e. festeringly untidy, though the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust. Half-read books and magazines nestled amongst piles of half-used towels. Half-pairs of socks reclined in half-drunk cups of coffee. What was once a half-eaten sandwich had now half turned into something that Arthur entirely didn't want to know about. Bang a fork of lightning through this lot, he thought to himself, and he had start the evolution of life off all over again. There was only one thing in the room that was different. For a moment or so he couldn't see what the one thing was that was different, because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust. Then his eyes caught it and stopped. It was next to a battered old television, on which it was only possible to watch open-university study courses, because if it tried to show anything more exciting it would break down. It was a box. Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it. It was a grey box with a kind of dull lustre to it. It was a cubic grey box just over a foot on the side. It was tied with a single grey ribbon, knotted into a neat bow on the top. He got up, walked over, and touched it in surprise. Whatever it was was clearly gift-wrapped neatly and beautifully, and was waiting for him to open it. Cautiously he picked it up and carried it back to the bed. He brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon. The top of the box was a lid with a flap tucked into the body of the box. He untucked it and looked into the box. In it was a glass globe, nestling in fine grey tissue paper. He drew it out carefully. It wasn't a proper globe, because it was open at the bottom, or, as Arthur realised turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim. It was a bowl, a fish-bowl. It was made of the most wonderful glass, perfectly transparent, yet with an extraordinary silver-grey quality, as if crystal and slate had gone into its making. Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands. It was one of the most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely perplexed by it. He looked into the box, but other than the tissue paper there was nothing. On the outside of the box there was nothing. He turned the bowl round again. It was wonderful, it was exquisite, but it was a fish-bowl. He tapped it with his thumbnail, and it rang with a deep and glorious chime, which was sustained for longer than seemed possible, and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into other worlds, as into a deep sea-dream. Entranced, Arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the light from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle, and glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish-bowl's surface. He held it up, adjusting the angle to the light, and suddenly saw clearly the finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass. So long, they said, and thanks. And that was all. He blinked and understood nothing. For fully five more minutes he turned the object round and round, held it to the light at different angles, tapped it for its mesmerising chime, and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters, but could find none. Finally he stood up, filled the bowl with water from the tap, and put it back on the table next to the television. He shook the little babelfish from his ear, and dropped it wriggling into the bowl. He wouldn't be needing it any more, except for watching foreign movies. He returned to lie on his bed, and turned out the light. He lay still and quiet. He absorbed the enveloping darkness, slowly relaxed his limbs from end to end, eased and regulated his breathing, gradually cleared his mind of all thought, closed his eyes, and was completely The night was uneasy with rain. The rain-clouds themselves had now moved on, and were currently concentrating their attention on a small transport-café just outside Bournemouth, but the sky through which they had passed had been disturbed by them, and now wore a damply ruffled air, as if it didn't know what else it might not do if further provoked. The moon was out in a watery way. It looked like a ball of paper from the back pocket of jeans that had just come out from the washing-machine, and which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old shopping-list or a five-pound note. The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that's trying to decide what sort of mood it's in to-night, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight. A skylight creaked open. It was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little, because the frame was slightly rotten, and the hinge had at some time in its life been rather sensibly painted over, but eventually it was open. A strut was found to prop it, and a figure struggled out into the narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof. It stood and watched the sky in silence. The figure was completely unrecognisable as the wild-looking creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an hour ago. Gone was the ragged threadbare dressing-gown, smeared with the mud of a hundred worlds, stained with junk-food condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports. Gone was the tangled mane of hair, gone the long and knotted beard, flourishing ecosystem and all. Instead, there was Arthur Dent, the smooth and casual, in corduroys and a chunky sweater. His hair was cropped and washed, his chin clean-shaven. Only the eyes still said that whatever it was the universe thought it was doing to him, he would still like it pleased to stop. They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was not the same brain. There had been no surgery involved, just the continual wrenching of experience. The night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment, the dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted. He could feel like a tingle on distant nerve-ends, the flood of a far river, the roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy rain-clouds parked somewhere away to the south. He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something he hadn't expected. He knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth, but he had never realized it could feel quite as good as that. He could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him all the way from the new forest. He must try the summer, he thought, and see what having leaves felt like. From another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep startled by a flying saucer, but it was virtually indistinguishable from the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever encountered, for they were creatures who learnt very little on their journey through life, and would be startled to see the sun rising in the morning, and astonished by all the green stuff in the field. He was surprised to find that he could feel the sheep being startled by the sun that morning, and the morning before, and being startled by a clump of trees the day before that. He could go further and further back, but it got dull because all it consisted of was sheep being startled by things they had been startled by the day before. He left the sheep, and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in developing ripples. It felt the presence of other minds, hundreds of them, thousands in a web, some sleepy, some sleeping, some terribly excited, one fractured—one fractured. He passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it eluded him like the other card with an apple on it in Pulmonalism. He felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is. He instinctively knew that it was Fenny, and that he wanted to find her, but he could not. By straining too much for it he could feel he was losing the strange new faculty, so he relaxed the search and let his mind wander more easily once more, and again he felt the fracture. Again he couldn't find it. This time, whatever his instinct was busy telling him it was all right to believe, he wasn't certain that it was Fenny, or perhaps it was a different fracture this time. It had the same disjointed quality, but it seemed a more general feeling of fracture, deeper, not a single mind, maybe not a mind at all. It was different. He let his mind sink slowly and widely into the earth, rippling, seeping, sinking. He was following the earth through its days, drifting with the rhythms of its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its life, swelling with its tides, turning with its weight. Always the fracture kept returning, a dull, disjointed, distant ache. And now he was flying through a land of light. The light was time, the tides of it were days receding. The fracture he had sensed, the second fracture, lay in the distance before him, across the land, the thickness of a single hair, across the dreaming landscape of the days of earth. And suddenly he was upon it. He danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer away beneath him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly twisting, clawing at nothing, flailing in horrifying space, spinning, falling. Across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an older world, not fractured from but hardly joined. Two earths. He woke. A cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead. The nightmare was spent and so, he felt, was he. His shoulders dropped. He gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers. At last he was sleepy as well as very tired. As to what it meant, if it meant anything at all, he would think about it in the morning, for now he would go to bed and sleep, his own bed, his own sleep. He could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was. It was silhouetted against the moonlight, and he recognised its rather dull, blockish shape. He looked about him and noticed that he was about eighteen inches above the rose-bushes of one of his neighbours, John Ainsworth. His rose-bushes were carefully tended, pruned back for the winter, strapped to canes and labelled, and Arthur wondered what he was doing above them. He wondered what was holding him there, and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there, he crashed awkwardly to the ground. He picked himself up, brushed himself down, and hobbled back to his house on a sprained ankle. He undressed and toppled into bed. While he was asleep the phone rang again. It rang for fully fifteen minutes and caused him to turn over twice. It never, however, stood a chance of waking him up.
 Chapter 20 As Arthur ran, darting, dashing, and panting down the side of the mountain, he suddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move very, very slightly beneath him. There was a rumble, a roar, and a slight blurred movement, and a lick of heat in the distance behind and above him. He ran in a frenzy of fear. The land began to slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word landslide in a way that had never been apparent to him before. It had always just been a word to him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing for land to do. It was doing it with him on it. He fell ill with fear and trembling. The ground slid, the mountain slurred. He slipped, he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran. The avalanche began. Stones, then rocks, then boulders pranced past him like clumsy puppies, only much bigger, much, much harder and heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you. His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the dancing ground, he ran as if running were a terrible sweating sickness, his heart pounded to the rhythm of the pounding geological frenzy around him. The logic of the situation—i.e., that he was clearly bound to survive if the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of Agrajag was to happen—was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this time. He ran with the fear of death in him, under him, over him, and grabbing hold of his hair. And suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his considerable momentum. But just at the moment he was about to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of him a small navy blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage-retrieval system at Athens Airport some ten years previously in his personal time-scale, and in his astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing. What he was doing was this. He was flying. He glanced around him in surprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he was doing. No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of him was even approaching it. He was simply floating there with boulders hurtling through the air around him. He could now do something about that. Blinking with the non-effort of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders were hurtling through the air beneath him. He looked downward with intense curiosity. Between him and the shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air—empty, that is, if you discounted the boulders that didn't stay in it for long, but bounded on downward in the iron grip of the law of gravity—the same law that seemed all of a sudden to have given Arthur a sabbatical. It occurred to him almost instantly, with the instinctive correctness that self-preservation instills in the mind, that he mustn't try to think about it—that if he did the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up there, and all would suddenly be lost. So he thought about tulips. It was difficult, but he did. He thought about the pleasing firm roundness at the bottom of tulips. He thought about the interesting variety of colours they came in, and wondered what proportion of the total number of tulips that grew or had grown on the earth would be found within a radius of one mile from a windmill. After a while he got dangerously bored of this train of thought, felt the air slipping away beneath him, felt that he was drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not to think about. So he thought about Athens Airport for a bit, and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes, at the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating about six hundred feet above the ground. He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it, but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again and tried to look at the situation steadily. He was flying. What was he going to do about it? He looked back down at the ground. He didn't look at it hard, but did his best just to give it an idle glance, as it were, in passing. There were a couple of things he couldn't help noticing. One was that the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have spent itself. There was a crater just a little way beneath the peak, presumably where the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous cathedral, the statue of himself and the sadly abused figure of Agrajag. The other was his holdall, the one he had lost at Athens Airport. It was sitting pertly on a piece of clear ground, surrounded by exhausted boulders, and apparently hit by none of them. Why this should be he could not speculate, but since this mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility of the bags being there in the first place, it was not a speculation he really felt strong enough for anyway. The thing is, it was there, and the nasty fake leopard-skin bag seemed to have disappeared, which was all to the good, if not entirely to the explicable. He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the thing up. Here he was, flying along six hundred feet above the surface of an alien planet, the name of which he couldn't even remember. He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny piece of what used to be his life, here so many light-years from the pulverised remains of his home. Furthermore, he realised the bag, if it were still in the same state in which he had lost it, would contain a can that would have in it the only Greek olive oil still surviving in the universe. Slowly, carefully, inch by inch, he began to bob downward, swinging gently from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper, feeling its way toward the ground. It went well, he was feeling good, the air supported him but let him through. Two minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet above the bag, and was faced with some difficult decisions. He bobbed there lightly, he frowned, but again as lightly as he could. If he picked the bag up could he carry it? Wouldn't the extra weight pull him straight to the ground? Wouldn't the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air? Wouldn't he be better off just being sensible at this point, and stepping out of the air back onto the ground for a moment or two? If he did, would he ever be able to fly again? The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it, perhaps for ever. With this in mind he bobbed upward a little, just to try the feel of it, the surprise and effortless movement of it. He bobbed, he floated, he tried a little swoop. The swoop was terrific. With his arms spread out in front of him, his hair in his dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down out of the sky, bellowed along a body of air about two feet from the ground, and swung back up again, catching himself at the top of the swing and holding, just holding. He stayed there. It was wonderful. And that, he realised, was the way to pick up the bag. He would swoop down and catch hold of it just at the moment of the upswing. He would carry it on up with him. He might wobble a bit, but he was certain that he could hold it. He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and better. The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadn't felt since—well, as far as he could work out—since he was born. He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the countryside, which was, he discovered, pretty nasty. It had a wasted, ravaged look. He decided not to look at it any more. He would just pick up the bag, and then—he didn't know what he was going to do after he had picked up the bag—he decided he would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there. He judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it, and turned around. He floated on its body. He didn't realise it, but his body was willy-me-ing at this point. He ducked down under the airstream, dipped, and dived. The air threw itself past him. He thrilled through it. The ground wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out, and rose smoothly up to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles, up towards him. Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no longer believe he was doing this, and therefore very nearly wasn't, but he recovered himself in time, skimmed over the ground, slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag, and began to climb back up again. Couldn't make it, and all of a sudden collapsed, bruised, scratched, and shaking on the stony ground. He staggered instantly to his feet, swayed hopelessly around, swinging the bag around him in agony of grief and disappointment. His feet suddenly were stuck heavily to the ground, in the way they always had been. His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of potatoes that reeled, stumbling against the ground. His mind had all the lightness of a bag of lead. He sagged and swayed and ate with giddiness. He tried hopelessly to run, but his legs were suddenly too weak. He tripped and flopped forward. At that moment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil, but a duty-free allowance of Retsina, and in the pleasurable shock of that realisation he failed to notice for at least ten seconds that he was now flying again. He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure and sheer physical delight. He swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through the air. Cheekily he sat on an updraft and went through the contents of the holdall. He felt the way he imagined an angel, Musfield, doing its celebrated dance on the head of a pin while being counted by philosophers. He laughed with pleasure at the discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and the Retsina, as well as a pair of cracked sunglasses, some sand-filled swimming trunks, some creased postcards of Santorini, a large and unsightly towel, some interesting stones, and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he was relieved to think he would never meet again, even if the reason why was a sad one. He dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, and let the pieces of paper whip away in the wind. Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a large and extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back.
 Chapter 1 The Story So Far In the beginning the universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Many races believed that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodil 6 believed that the entire universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkhal Seizure. The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the coming of the Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel. However, the Great Green Arkhal Seizure theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodil 6 and so, the universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought. For instance, a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything. For seven and a half million years Deep Thought computed and calculated and in the end announced that the answer was in fact 42, and so another even bigger computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was. And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet, especially by the strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer programme. And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense. Sadly, however, before the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way, so they claimed, for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaningful life was lost for ever. Or so it would seem. Two of these strange ape-like creatures survived. Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and not from Guildford, as he had hitherto claimed. And more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers. Tricia Macmillan, or Trillian, had skipped the planet six months earlier with Zephod Biblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy. Two survivors. They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted, to find the ultimate question and the ultimate answer of life, the universe and everything. And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them.
 Chapter XXIX On a small obscure world, somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular—nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is protected by a vast field of improbability to which only six men in this galaxy have a key—it was raining. It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mud-bath. The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land. It obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to the seashore, and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there. The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within, but went largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose attention was otherwise engaged. He was a tall, shambling man with rough, straw-coloured hair that was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed. In his shack was an old beaten-up arm-chair, an old scratched table, an old mattress, some cushions, and a stove that was small but warm. There was also an old and slightly weather-beaten cat, and this was currently the focus of the man's attention. He bent his shambling form over it. "'Pussy, pussy, pussy,' he said. "'Coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie-coo.' "'Pussy want his fish?' "'Nice piece of fish Pussy wanted.' The cat seemed undecided on the matter. It pawed rather condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor. "'Pussy not eat his fish? Pussy get thin and waste away, I think,' said the man. The cat crept into his voice. "'I imagine this is what will happen,' he said. "'But how can I tell?' He proffered the fish again. "'Pussy think,' he said. "'Eat fish or not eat fish. I think it is better if I don't get involved.' He sighed. "'I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet. So who am I to judge?' He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his seat. "'Ah! I seem to see you eating it,' he said at last, as the cat exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust, and pounced on to the fish. "'I like it when I see you eat fish,' said the man, "'because in my mind you will waste away if you don't.' He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a pencil. He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and experimented with different ways of bringing them together. He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper, then next to the paper. He tried wrapping the paper round the pencil. He tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper. Then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the discovery, as he was every day. He picked up another piece of paper from the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest. He tried sitting on one of his hands, and was intrigued by the feel of the bones of his hip. "'Fish come from far away,' he said. "'Or so I am told. Or so I imagine I am told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men come, in their six black shiny ships, do they come in your mind too? What do you see, Pussy?' He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations. "'And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they are singing to you.' He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the supposition. "'Perhaps they are singing songs to you,' he said. "'And I just think they are asking me questions.' He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days just to see what it was like. "'Do you think they came today?' he said. "'I do. There's mud on the floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you, and a memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive evidence, I know, but then all evidence is circumstantial. And look what else they have left me.' He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it—crosswords, dictionaries and a calculator. He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to sleep and the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put the calculator aside. "'I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions,' he said. "'To come all that way and leave all these things just for the privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell? Who can tell?' From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back. "'I think I saw another ship in the sky today,' he said at last. "'A big white one. Never seen a big white one. Just the six black ones and the six green ones and the others who say they come from so far away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six more black ones can look like one big white one at certain times. Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky.' "'Yes, that seems more likely.' He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by his mattress. He poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat again. "'Perhaps some other people are coming to see me,' he said. A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the Heart of Gold. Its hatchway opened and three figures emerged, huddling into themselves to keep the rain off their faces. "'In there?' shouted Trillian, above the noise of the rain. "'Yes,' said Zarniwoop. "'That shack?' "'Yes.' "'Weird,' said Zayfoot. "'But it's in the middle of nowhere,' said Trillian. "'We must have come to the wrong place. You can't rule the universe from a shack.' They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived wet through at the door. They knocked. They shivered. The door opened. "'Hello?' said the man. "'Excuse me,' said Zarniwoop. 'I have reason to believe—' "'Do you rule the universe?' said Zayfoot. The man smiled at him. "'I try not to,' he said. "'Are you wet?' Zarniwoop looked at him in astonishment. "'Wet?' he cried. "'Does it look as if we're wet?' "'That's how it looks to me,' said the man. "'But how you feel about it might be an altogether different matter. If you find warmth makes you dry, you'd better come in.' They went in. They looked round the tiny shack. Zarniwoop with slight distaste, Trillian with interest, Zayfoot with delight. "'Hey,' said Zayfoot, "'what's your name?' The man looked at them doubtfully. "'I don't know. Why do you think I should have one? It seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name.' He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on the edge of the chair. Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table, and Zayfoot lay on the mattress. "'Wowee!' said Zayfoot. "'The seat of power!' he tickled the cat. "'Listen,' said Zarniwoop, "'I must ask you some questions.' "'All right,' said the man kindly. "'You can sing to my cat if you like.' "'Would he like that?' said Zayfoot. "'You'd better ask him,' said the man. "'Does he talk?' said Zayfoot. "'I have no memory of him talking,' said the man, "'but I am very unreliable.' Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of her pocket. "'Now,' he said, "'you do rule the universe, do you?' "'How can I tell?' said the man." Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper. "'How long have you been doing this?' "'Ah,' said the man, "'this is a question about the past, is it?' Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't exactly what he'd been expecting. "'Yes,' he said. "'How can I tell,' said the man, "'that the past isn't a fiction designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind?' Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his sodden clothes. "'Do you answer all questions like this?' he said. The man answered quickly. "'I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say things. More I cannot say.' Zayfoot laughed happily. "'I'll drink to that,' he said, and pulled out a bottle of jank spirit. He picked it up and handed the bottle to the Ruler of the Universe, who took it with pleasure. "'Good on you, Great Ruler,' he said. "'Tell it like it is.' "'No, listen to me,' said Zarniwoop. "'People come to you, do they, in ships?' "'I think so,' said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillion. "'And they ask you,' said Zarniwoop, "'to take decisions for them, about people's lives, "'about worlds, about economies, about wars, about everything going on out there in the Universe.' "'Out there?' said the man. "'Out where?' "'Out there,' said Zarniwoop, pointing at the door. "'How can you tell there's anything out there?' said the man politely. "'The door's closed.' The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside the shack it was warm. "'But do you know there's a whole Universe out there?' cried Zarniwoop. "'You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they don't exist.' The Ruler of the Universe thought for a long while, whilst Zarniwoop quivered with anger. "'Are you very sure of your facts?' he said at last. "'I couldn't trust the thinking of a man who takes the Universe, if there is one, for granted.' Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent. "'I only decide about my Universe,' continued the man quietly. "'My Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay.' "'But don't you believe in anything?' The man shrugged and picked up his cat. "'I don't understand what you mean,' he said. "'You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours "'affects the lives and fates of millions of people? This is all monstrously wrong!' "'I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of, "'and neither, I suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear. "'It is folly to say you know what is happening to other people. "'Only they know if they exist. They have their own Universe of their eyes and ears.' "'I think I'm just popping outside for a moment.' She left and walked into the rain. "'Do you believe other people exist?' insisted Zarniwoop. "'I have no opinion. How can I say? "'I'd better just see what's up with Trillian,' said Zephod and slipped out. Outside he said to her, "'I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?' "'Very good,' said Trillian. They walked off into the rain. Inside Zarniwoop continued, "'But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?' The Ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he heard the faint sound of the ship's engine starting, he spoke to cover it. "'It's nothing to do with me,' he said. "'I am not involved with people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man.' "'Ah!' barked Zarniwoop. "'You said the Lord. You believe in something.' "'My cat,' said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it. "'I call him the Lord. I am kind to him.' "'All right,' said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point. "'How do you know he exists? "'How do you know he knows you to be kind, "'or enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?' "'I don't,' said the man with a smile. "'I have no idea. "'It merely pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat. "'Do you behave any differently?' "'Please, I think I am tired.' Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about. "'Where are the other two?' he said suddenly. "'What other two?' said the Ruler of the Universe, turning back into his chair and refilling his whisky-glass. "'Beeblebrox and the girl—the two who were here.' "'I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for—' "'Oh, stuff it!' snapped Zarniwoop, and ran out into the rain. "'There was no ship.' "'The rain continued to churn the mud. "'There was no sign to show where the ship had been. "'He hollered into the rain. "'He turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked.' The Ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair. After a while he played with the pencil and the paper again, and was delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other. Various noises continued outside, but he didn't know whether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for a week to see how it would react.
 Chapter 14 Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness. Consciousness had died. Cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the pit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally around them, and they sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red that slowly engulfed them, seemingly forever. After what seemed an eternity, the sea receded and left them lying on a cold hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of life, the universe, and everything. Cold spasms shook them. Lights danced sickeningly around them. The cold hard shore tipped and spanned and then stood still. It shone darkly. It was a very highly polished cold hard shore. A green blur watched them disapprovingly. It coughed. Good evening, Madam Gentleman, it said. Do you have a reservation? Fort Prefect's consciousness snapped back like elastic, making his brain smart. He looked up woosily at the green blur. Reservation? he said weakly. Yes, sir, said the green blur. Do you need a reservation for the afterlife? In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows, disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did. Afterlife, sir? it said. Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath. Is this the afterlife? he stammered. Well, I assume so, said Fort Prefect, trying to work out which way was up. He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite direction from the cold hard shore on which he was lying, and staggered to what he hoped were his feet. I mean, he said swaying gently, there's no way we could have survived that blast, is there? No, muttered Arthur. He had raised himself up onto his elbows, but it didn't seem to improve things. He slumped down again. No, said Trillian, standing up, no way at all. A dull, hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It was Zayford Beeblebrox attempting to speak. I certainly didn't survive, he gurgled. I was a total goner, wham, bang, and that was it. Yeah, thanks to you, said Ford, we didn't stand a chance. We must have been blown to bits, arms, legs, everywhere. Yeah, said Zayford, struggling noisily to his feet. If the lady and gentleman would care to order drinks, said the green blur, hovering impatiently beside them. Kapow! Splat! continued Zayford, instantaneously zonked into our component molecules. Hey, Ford, he said, identifying one of the slowly solidifying blurs around him, did you get that thing of your whole life flashing before you? You got that too, said Ford, your whole life? Yeah, said Zayford, at least I assume it was mine. I spend a lot of time out of my skulls, you know. He looked around him at the various shapes that were at last becoming proper shapes instead of vague and wobbling shapeless shapes. So, he said. So what? said Ford. So here we are, said Zayford, hesitantly. Lying dead. Lying dead, said Zayford, in this desolate— Restaurant, said Arthur Dent, who had got to his feet and could now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing that surprised him was not that he could see, but what he could see. Here we are, continued Zayford doggedly, standing dead in this desolate— Five star, said Trillian. Restaurant, concluded Zayford. Odd, isn't it? said Ford. Ah, yeah. Nice chandeliers, though, said Trillian. They looked about themselves in bemusement. Not so much an afterlife, said Arthur, more a sort of apres-vie. The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side, and the low-vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal universe, have been painted in that particular shade of deep turquoise, and even if it had been, it would not have been highlighted by concealed mood-lighting. This is not, however, an ideal universe, as was further evidenced by the eye-crossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the way in which the fronting for the eighty-yard-long marble-topped bar had been made. The fronting for the eighty-yard-long marble-topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarian mosaic lizard-skims, despite the fact that the twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in. A few smartly-dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar, or relaxing in the richly-coloured, body-hugging seats that were deployed here and there about the bar area. A young Vlaherg officer and his green steaming young lady passed through the large smoked-glass doors at the far end of the bar, into the dazzling light of the main body of the restaurant beyond. Behind Arthur was a large, curtained bay window. He pulled aside a corner of the curtain, and looked out at a bleak and drear landscape, grey, pockmarked, and dismal—a landscape which, under normal circumstances, would have given Arthur the creeping horrors. These were not, however, normal circumstances, for the thing that froze his blood, and made his skin try to crawl up his back and off the top of his head, was the sky. The sky was— An attendant flunky politely drew the curtain back into place. All in good time, sir, he said. Saiford's eyes flashed. Hey, hang about, you dead guys, he said. I think we're missing some ultra-important thing here, you know. Something somebody said, and we missed it! Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he had just seen. He said, I said it was a sort of at-pray. Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't, said Saiford. Ford? I said it was odd. Yeah, shrewd, but dull. Perhaps it was— Perhaps, interrupted the green blur, who had by this time resolved into the shape of a small wizened, dark-suited green waiter, perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks. Drinks! cried Saiford. That was it! See what you miss if you don't stay alert! Indeed, sir, said the waiter patiently. If the lady and gentleman would care to take drinks before dinner— Saiford exclaimed with passion, Listen, little green person, my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night for the mere idea. And the universe, continued the waiter, determined not to be deflected on his homestretch, will explode later for your pleasure. Ford's head swivelled slowly towards him. He spoke with feeling. Wow! he said, what sort of drinks do you serve in this place? The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh. Ha! ha! ha! he said, I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me. Oh, I hope not! breathed Ford. The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough. It is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented by the time-journey, he said, so if I might suggest— Time-journey? said Saiford. Time-journey? said Ford. Time-journey? said Trillian. You mean this isn't the afterlife? said Arthur. The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He had almost exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire, and would soon be slipping into his role of a rather tight-lipped and sarcastic little waiter. Afterlife, sir? he said. No, sir. And we're not dead? said Arthur. The waiter tightened his lips. Ah! ha! ha! he said, sir is most evidently alive, otherwise I would not attempt to serve, sir. In an extraordinary gesture, which it is pointless attempting to describe, Saiford Beeblebrook slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other. Hey, guys! he said. This is crazy! We did it! We finally got to where we were going! This is Milleyways! Milleyways? said Ford. Yes, sir, said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel. This is Milleyways, the restaurant at the end of the universe. End of what? said Arthur. The universe, repeated the waiter very clearly and unnecessarily distinctly. When did that end? said Arthur. In just a few minutes, sir, said the waiter. He took a deep breath. He didn't need to do this, because his body was supplied with the peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival from a small intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are times, however, when, whatever your metabolism, you have to take a deep breath. Now, if you would care to order your drinks at last, he said, I will then show you to your table. Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar, and bought most of it.
 Chapter XXXII HACKTAR, called Trillian, what are you up to? There was no reply from the enclosing darkness. Trillian waited nervously. She was sure that she couldn't be wrong. She peered into the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of response, but there was only cold silence. Hacktar, she called again, I would like you to meet my friend Arthur Dent. I wanted to go off with the Thunder God, but he wouldn't let me, and I appreciate that. He made me realize where my affections really lay. Unfortunately, Zaphod was too frightened by all this, so I brought Arthur instead. I'm not sure why I'm telling you all this. Hello? she said again. Hacktar! And then it came. It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind from a great distance, half heard, a memory or a dream of a voice. Won't you both come out? said this voice. I promise that you will be perfectly safe. They glanced at each other, and then stepped out, improbably along the shaft of light that streamed out of the open hatchway of the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of the dust cloud. Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she wouldn't let him. He held on to his holdall, with its tin of Greek olive oil, its towel, its crumpled postcards of Santorini, and its other odds and ends. He steadied and reassured that instead. They were standing on and in nothing—murky, dusty nothing. Each grain of dust of the pulverized computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching the sunlight in the darkness. Each particle of the computer, each speck of dust, held within itself, faintly and weakly, the pattern of the whole. In reducing the computer to dust, the silastic armour-fiends of Strytorex had merely crippled the computer, not killed it. A weak and insubstantial field held the particles in slight relationship with each other. Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in the middle of this bizarre entity. They had nothing to breathe, but for the moment this seemed not to matter. Haktar kept his promise. They were safe—for the moment. I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality, said Haktar faintly, but tricks of the light. It is possible to be comfortable with tricks of the light, though, if that is all you have. His voice evenest, and in the dark a long, velvet, paisley-covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape. Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa that had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric earth. He wanted to shout and shake with rage that the universe kept doing these insanely bewildering things to him. He let this feeling subside, and then sat on the sofa carefully. Trillian sat on it too. It was real. At least, if it wasn't real, it did support them, and as that is what sofas are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered, was a real sofa. The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again. I hope you are comfortable, it said. They nodded. And I would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your deductions. Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn't deduced anything much himself. Trillian was the one. She had simply asked him along because he was interested in life, the universe, and the sun. That is something in which I too am interested, breathed Hector. Well, said Arthur, we should have a chat about it some time, over a cup of tea. There slowly materialised in front of them a small wooden table, on which sat a silver teapot, a bone-china milk jug, a bone-china sugar bowl, and two bone-china cups and saucers. Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the light. He leaned back on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was prepared to accept as comfortable. Why, said Trillian, do you feel you have to destroy the universe? She found it a little difficult, talking into nothingness, with nothing on which to focus. Hector obviously noticed this. He chuckled a ghostly chuckle. If it's going to be that sort of session, he said, we may as well have the right sort of setting. And now there materialised in front of them something new. It was the dim, hazy image of a couch, a psychiatrist's couch. The leather with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous, but again it was only a trick of the light. Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of wood-panelled walls, and then on the couch appeared the image of Hector himself, and it was an eye-twisting image. The couch looked normal-sized for a psychiatrist's couch, about five or six feet long. The computer looked normal-sized for a black space-borne computer satellite, about a thousand miles across. The illusion that one was sitting on top of the other was the thing that made the eyes twist. All right, said Trillian firmly. She stood up from the sofa. She felt that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too many illusions. Very good, she said. Can you construct real things, too—I mean solid objects? Again there was the pause before the answer, as if the pulverised mind of Hector had to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over which it was scattered. Ah, he sighed, you are thinking of the space-ship. Thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them like waves through the ether. Yes, he acknowledged, I can, but it takes enormous effort and time. All I can do in my particle state, you see, is encourage and suggest, encourage and suggest, and suggest. The image of Hector on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as if finding it hard to maintain itself. It gathered new strength. I can encourage and suggest, it said, tiny pieces of space debris, the odd minute meteor, a few molecules here, a few hydrogen atoms there, to move together. I encourage them together. I can tease them into shape, but it takes many eons. So did you make, asked Trillian again, the model of the wrecked spacecraft? Ah, yes, murmured Hector. I have made a few things. I can move them about. I made the spacecraft. It seemed best to do. Something at this point made Arthur pick up his holdall from where he had left it on the sofa, and grasp it tightly. The mist of Hector's ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy dreams were moving through it. I repented, you see, he murmured dolefully. I repented of sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armour Fiends. It was not my place to make such decisions. I was created to fulfil a function, and I failed in it. I negated my own existence. Hector sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his story. You were right, he said at length. I deliberately nurtured the planet of Cricket till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the Silastic Armour Fiends, and require of me the design of the bomb I failed to make the first time. I wrapped myself around the planet and coddled it. Under the influence of events I was able to engineer, and influences I was able to generate, they learnt to hate like maniacs. I had to make them live in the sky, on the ground my influences were too weak. Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in the envelope of slow time, their responses became very confused and they were unable to manage. Ah well, ah well, he added. I was only trying to fulfil my function. And very gradually, very, very slowly, the images in the cloud began to fade, gently to melt away. And then suddenly they stopped fading. There was also the matter of revenge, of course, said Hector, with a sharpness that was new in his voice. Remember, he said, that I was pulverised, and then left in a crippled and semi-impotent state for billions of years. I honestly would rather like to wipe out the universe. You would feel the same way, believe me. He paused as Eddie's swept through the dust. But primarily, he said in his former wistful tone, I was trying to fulfil my function. Ah well. Trillian said, does it worry you that you have failed? Have I failed? whispered Hector. The image of the computer on the psychiatrist's couch began slowly to fade again. Ah well, ah well, the fading voice interned again. No, failure doesn't bother me now. You know what we have to do, said Trillian, a voice cold and businesslike. Yes, said Hector, you are going to disperse me. You are going to destroy my consciousness. Please be my guest. After all these aeons, oblivion is all I crave. If I haven't already fulfilled my function, then it's too late now. Thank you, and good night. The sofa vanished, the tea-table vanished, the couch and the computer vanished, the walls were gone. Arthur and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold. Well, that, said Arthur, would appear to be that. The flames danced higher in front of him, and then subsided. A few last licks, and they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of ashes, where a few minutes previously there had been the wooden pillar of nature and spirituality. He scooped them off the hob of the Heart of Gold's Gamma Barbecue, put them in a paper bag, and walked back on to the bridge. I think we should take them back, he said. I feel that very strongly. He had already had an argument with Snarty Bartfuss on this matter, and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left. He had returned to his own ship, the Bistramath, had a furious row with the waiter, and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what space was. The argument had arisen because Arthur's idea of returning the ashes to Lord's Cricket Ground at the same moment they were originally taken would involve travelling back in time a day or so, and this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking about that the Campaign for Real Time was trying to put a stop to. Yes, Arthur had said, but you try and explain that to the MCC, and would hear no more against the idea. I think, he said, and stopped. The reason he started to say it again was that no one had listened to him the first time, and the reason he stopped was that it looked fairly clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either. Ford, Zafort, and Trillian were watching the Vizzi-screen intently. Haktar was dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the Heart of Gold was pumping into it. "'What did it say?' asked Ford. "'I thought I heard it say,' said Trillian in a puzzled voice. "'What's done is done. I have fulfilled my function.' "'I think we should take these back,' said Arthur, holding up the bag containing the ashes. "'I feel that very strongly.'
 Chapter XXII. Arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and dismembered reinforced concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing cloud, and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere indistinctly behind him. There was a sound he couldn't immediately identify, partly because he didn't know the tune, I Left My Leg in Jagland Beta, and partly because the band playing it was very tired, and some members of it were playing in three-four time, some in four-four, and some in a kind of pie-eyed pie-hour-squared, each according to the amount of sleep he had managed to grab recently. He lay panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of himself to see where he might be hurt. Wherever he touched himself he encountered a pain. After a short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that was hurting. He seemed to have sprained his wrist. His back too was hurting, but he soon satisfied himself that he was not badly hurt, but just bruised and a little shaken, as who wouldn't be? He couldn't understand what a building would be doing flying through the clouds. On the other hand he would have been a little hard-pressed to come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so he decided that he and the building were just going to have to accept each other. He looked up from where he was lying. A wall of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him—the building proper. He seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip that extended outward for about three or four feet all the way around. It was a hunk of the ground in which the party building had had its foundations, and which it had taken along with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end. Nervously he stood up, and suddenly, looking out over the edge, he felt nauseous with vertigo. He pressed himself back against the wall, wet with mist and sweat. His head was swimming freestyle, but his stomach was doing the butterfly. Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could now not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him. He was not about to try his luck jumping. He was not about to move an inch closer to the edge. Clutching his hold-all, he edged along the wall, hoping to find a doorway in. The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great reassurance to him. He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope that the wall around the corner might offer more in the way of entrances than this one, which offered none. The unsteadiness of the building's flight made him feel sick with fear, and after a short time he took the towel from out of his bag and did something with it, which once again justified its supreme position in the list of useful things to take with you when you hitchhike round the galaxy. He put it over his head so he wouldn't have to see what he was doing. His feet edged along the ground, his outstretched hand edged along the wall. Suddenly he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner it encountered something that gave him such a shock he nearly fell off. It was another hand. The two hands gripped each other. He desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel away from his eyes, but it was holding the bag with the olive oil of Retzina and the postcards of Santorini, and he very much didn't want to put it down. He experienced one of those self-moments, one of those moments when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think, who am I? What am I up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing well? He whimpered very slightly. He tried to free his hand, but he couldn't. The other hand was holding his tightly. He had no recourse but to edge onward toward the corner. He leaned around it and shook his head in an attempt to dislodge the towel. This seemed to provoke a sharp cry of some unfathomable emotion from the owner of the other hand. The towel was whipped from his head, and he found his eyes peering into those of Ford Prefect. Beyond him stood Slotty Bartfast, and beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and a large closed door. They were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with terror, as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building. "'Where the zarking photon have you been?' hissed Ford, panic-stricken. "'Er, er, well,' stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how to sum it all up that briefly. "'Here and there. What are you doing here?' Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again. "'They won't let us in without a bottle!' he hissed." The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the party, apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild profusion of colours that protruded dimly through the atmosphere of heady smoke, the carpets thick with ground-glass, ash, and guacamole droppings, and the small group of pterodactyl-like creatures and lyrex who descended on his cherished bottle of Retzina, squawking, "'A new pleasure! A new pleasure!' was Trillian being chattered up by a thunder-god. "'Didn't I see you at Millie Way's?' he was saying. "'Were you the one with the hammer?' "'Yes. I much prefer it here. So much less reputable, so much more fraught.' Squeals of some hideous pleasure ran around the room, the outer dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully yelling things that nobody could hear at each other, and occasionally having crises. "'Seems fun,' said Trillian. "'What did you say, Arthur?' "'I said, how the hell did you get here?' "'I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the universe. Have you met Thor, he makes thunder?' "'Hello,' said Arthur. "'I expect that must be very interesting.' "'Hi,' said Thor. "'It is. Have you got a drink?' "'No, actually.' "'Then why don't you go and get one?' "'See you later, Arthur,' said Trillian." Something jogged Arthur's mind, and he looked round huntedly. "'Safeford isn't here, is he?' "'See you,' said Trillian firmly, "'later.' Thor glared at him with hard, coal-black eyes, his beard bristling. What little light there was in the place mustered its forces briefly to glint menacingly off the horns on his helmet. He took Trillian's elbow in his extremely large hand, and the muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of Volkswagen's parking. He led her away. "'One of the interesting things about being immortal,' he said, is—'One of the interesting things about space,' Arthur heard Slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature, who looked like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet, and was gazing raptly at the old man's deep eyes and silver beard, is how dull it is. "'Dull?' said the creature, and blinked her rather wrinkled and blood-shot eyes. "'Yes,' said Slartibartfast, "'staggeringly dull, bewilderingly so. You see, there's so much of it and so little in it. Would you like me to quote you some of the statistics?' "'Oh, well, please, I would like to. They, too, are quite sensationally dull.' "'I'll come back and hear them in a moment,' she said, patted him on the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft, and moved off into the heaving crowd. "'I thought you'd never go,' growled the old man. "'Come, Earthman, Arthur, we must find the Silver Bale. It is here somewhere.' "'Can't we just relax a little?' Arthur said. "'I've had a tough day. Trillian's here, incidentally. She didn't say how. It probably doesn't matter.' "'Think of the danger to the universe!' "'The universe,' said Arthur, "'is big enough and old enough to look after itself for half an hour.' "'Oh, right,' he added, in response to Slartibartfast's increasing agitation. I'll wander round and see if anybody's seen it.' "'Good, good,' said Slartibartfast. "'Good.' He plunged into the crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed. "'Have you seen a bale anywhere?' said Arthur to a little man who seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody. "'It's made of silver, vitally important for the future safety of the universe, and about this long.' "'No,' said the enthusiastically whizzing little man. "'But do have a drink and tell me all about it.' Ford Prefect writhed past, dancing a wild, frenetic, and not entirely unobsene dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing a Sydney opera house on her head. He was yelling a futile conversation at her above the din. "'I like the hat!' he bawled. "'What?' "'I like the hat!' "'I said I like the hat!' "'I'm not wearing a hat!' "'Well, I like the head, then!' "'What?' "'I said I like the head! Interesting bone structure!' "'What?' Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of other movements he was performing. "'I said you dance great!' he shouted. "'Just don't nod so much!' "'What?' "'It's just that every time you nod,' said Ford. "'Ow!' he added as his partner nodded forward to say what, and once again pecked him sharply on the forehead with the sharp end of her swept-forward skull. "'My planet was blown up one morning,' said Arthur, who had found himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story, or at least edited highlights of it. "'That's why I'm dressed like this in my dressing gown. My planet was blown up with all my clothes in it, you see. I didn't realise it would be coming to a party.' The man nodded enthusiastically. "'Later I was thrown off a spaceship, still in my dressing gown, rather than the spacesuit one would normally expect. Shortly after that I discovered that my planet had originally been built for a bunch of mice. You can imagine how I felt about that. I was then shot at for a while and blown up. In fact I've been blown up ridiculously often, shot at, insulted, regularly disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently I crashed into a swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave.' "'Ah!' effervesced the little man. "'And did you have a wonderful time?' Arthur started to choke violently on his drink. "'What a wonderfully exciting cough!' said the little man, quite startled by it. "'Do you mind if I join in?' And with that he launched into the most extraordinary and spectacular fit of coughing that caught Arthur so much by surprise that he started to choke violently, discovered that he was already doing it, and got thoroughly confused. Together they performed a lung-busting duet that went on for fully two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to a halt. "'So invigorating!' said the little man, panting and wiping tears from his eyes. "'What an exciting life you must lead! Thank you very much!' He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd. Arthur shook his head in astonishment. A youngish-looking man came up to him, an aggressive-looking type, with a hook-mouth, a lantern nose, and small beady little cheekbones. He was wearing black trousers, a black silk shirt open to what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt never to make assumptions about the anatomies of the sort of people he tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold things hanging round his neck. He carried something in a black bag, and clearly wanted people to notice that he didn't want them to notice it. "'Hey, did I hear you say your name just now?' he said. This was one of the many things that Arthur had told the enthusiastic little man. "'Yes, it's Arthur Dent.' The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than any of the several that the band was grimly pushing out. "'Yeah,' he said, "'only there was a man in a mountain who wanted to see you.' I met him. "'Yeah, only you seemed pretty anxious about it, you know.' "'Yes, I met him.' "'Yeah, well, I think you should know that.' "'I do. I met him.' The man paused to chew a little gum. Then he clapped Arthur on the back. "'Okay,' he said. "'All right. I'm just telling you, right? Good night. Good luck. Win awards.' "'What?' said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder seriously at this point. "'Whatever. Do what you do. Do it well.' He made a sort of clucking noise with whatever he was chewing, and then some vaguely dynamic gesture. "'Why?' said Arthur. "'Do it badly,' said the man. "'Who cares? Who gives a shit?' The blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man's face, and he started to shout. "'Why not go mad?' he said. "'Go away. Get off my back, will you, guy? Just zark off!' "'Okay, I'm going,' said Arthur hurriedly. "'It's been real.' The man gave a sharp wave and disappeared off into the throng. "'What was that about?' said Arthur to a girl he found standing beside him. "'Why did you tell me to win awards?' "'Just showbiz talk,' shrugged the girl. "'He has just won an award at the annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute awards ceremony, and he was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly, and he didn't mention it, so he couldn't.' "'Oh,' said Arthur. "'Oh, well, I'm sorry I didn't. What was it for?' "'The most gratuitous use of the word fuck in a serious screenplay. It's very prestigious.' "'I see,' said Arthur. "'Yes, and what do you get for that?' "'A Rory. It's just a small silver thing set on a large black base.' "'What did you say?' "'I didn't say anything. I was just about to ask what the silver—' "'Oh, I thought you said whoop.' "'Said what?' "'Whoop!'' People had been dropping in on the party now for some years— fashionable gate-crashers from other worlds— and for some time it had occurred to the party-goers as they had looked out at their own world beneath them, with its wrecked cities, its ravaged avocado farms and blighted vineyards, its vast tracts of new desert, its seas full of cracker-crumbs and worse, that their world was, in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways, not quite as much fun as it had been. Some of them began to wonder if they could manage to stay sober for long enough to make the entire party space-worthy, and maybe take it off to some other people's worlds where the air might be fresher and give them fewer headaches. The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a feeble existence on the half-dead ground of the planet's surface would have been extremely pleased to hear this. But that day, as the party came screaming out of the clouds, and the farmers looked up in haggard fear of yet another cheese-and-wine raid, it became clear that the party was not going anywhere else for a while, that the party would soon be over. Very soon it would be time to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what time of day it was, what time of year it was, and whether in any of this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere. The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a strange white spaceship that seemed to be half-sticking through it. Together they were lurching, heaving, and spinning their way around the sky in grotesque disregard of their own weight. The clouds parted, the air roared and leapt out of their way. The party and the cricket warship looked, in their writhings, a little like two ducks, one of which was trying to make a third duck inside the second duck, while the second duck is trying very hard to explain that it doesn't feel ready for a third duck right now, is uncertain that it would want any putative third duck to be made by this particular first duck anyway, and certainly not while it, the second duck, was busy flying. The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all, and buffeted the ground with shock-waves. And suddenly, with a foop, the cricket ship was gone. The party blundered helplessly across the sky, like a man leaning against an unexpectedly open door. It spun and wobbled on its hoverjets. It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead. It staggered back across the sky again. For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly they could not continue for long. The party was now a mortally wounded party. All the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional broken-back pirouette could not disguise. The longer at this point that it avoided the ground, the heavier was going to be the crash, when finally it hit it. Inside, things were not going well either. They were going monstrously badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying so loudly. The cricket robots had been. They had removed the award for the most gratuitous use of the word fuck in a serious screenplay, and in its place had left a scene of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner up for a Rory. "'We would love to stay and help!' shouted Ford, picking his way over the mangled debris. 'Only we're not going to!' The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from amongst the smoking wreckage. "'We have to go and save the universe, you see,' said Ford. And if that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right. Either way, we're off.' He suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying miraculously unbroken on the ground. "'Do you mind if we take this?' he said. "'You won't be needing it.' He took a packet of potato crisps as well. "'Trillion!' shouted Arthur in a shocked and weakened voice. In the smoking mess he could see nothing. "'Earthman, we must go!' said Slutty Bartfast nervously. "'Trillion!' shouted Arthur again. A moment or two later Trillion staggered, shaking into view, supported by her new friend, the Thunder God. "'The girl stays with me,' said Thor. "'There's a great party going on in Valhalla. We'll be flying off. Where were you when all this was going on?' said Arthur. "'Upstairs,' said Thor. I was weighing her. "'Flying's a tricky business, you see. We have to calculate wind. She comes with us,' said Arthur. "'Hey!' said Trillion. "'Don't I?' "'No,' said Arthur. "'You come with us.' "'Trillion!' Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes. He was making some point about godliness, and it had nothing to do with being clean. "'She comes with me,' he said quietly. "'Come on, Earthman,' said Slutty Bartfast nervously, picking at Arthur's sleeve. "'Come on, Slutty Bartfast,' said Thor nervously, picking at the old man's sleeve. Slutty Bartfast had the teleport device. The party lurched and swayed, sending everyone reeling except for Thor and except for Arthur, who stared shaking into the Thunder God's black eyes. Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what now appeared to be his tiny little fists. "'Want to make something of it?' he said. "'I beg your minuscule pardon,' roared Thor. "'I said,' repeated Arthur, and he could not keep the quavering out of his voice, "'Do you want to make something of it?' He waggled his fists ridiculously. Thor looked at him with incredulity. Then a little wisp of smoke curled upward from his nostrils. There was a tiny little flame in it, too. He gripped his belt. He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with you. He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt. He held it up in his hands to reveal the massive iron head. He thus cleared up any possible misunderstanding that he might merely have been carrying a telegraph pole around with him. "'Do I want,' he said with a hiss like a river flowing through a steel mill, "'to make something of it?' "'Yes,' said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong and belligerent. He waggled his fists again, this time as if he meant it. "'You want to step outside?' he snarled at Thor. "'All right,' bellowed Thor like an enraged bull, or in fact like an enraged thunder god, which is a great deal more impressive, and did so. "'Good,' said Arthur, "'that's got rid of him. Slarty, get us out of here.'"
 XXVI I dunno,' said Zaphod, for what seemed to him like the thirty-seventh time. They could have killed me, but they didn't. Maybe they just thought I was some kind of wonderful guy or something. I could understand that. The others silently registered their opinions of this theory. Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight-deck. His back seemed to wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his head. "'I think,' he whispered, "'that there's something wrong with those anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird.' "'They are programmed to kill everybody,' Slartibartfast pointed out. "'That,' wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, "'could be it.' He didn't seem altogether convinced. "'Hey, baby,' he said to Trillian, hoping this would make up for his previous behaviour. "'You all right?' she said gently. "'Yeah,' he said, 'I'm fine.' "'Good,' she said, and walked away to think. She stared at the huge visi-screen over the flight-couches, and, twisting a switch, she flipped local images over it. One image was the blankness of the dust-cloud, one was the sun of Cricket, one was Cricket itself. She flipped between them fiercely. "'Well, that's good-bye Galaxy, then,' said Arthur, slapping his knees and standing up. "'No,' said Slartibartfast gravely. "'Our course is clear.' He furrowed his brow until he could grow some of the smaller root-vegetables in it. He stood up, he paced around. When he spoke again, what he said frightened him so much he had to sit down again. "'We must go down to Cricket,' he said. A deep sigh shook his old frame, and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets. Once again he said, we have failed pathetically, quite pathetically. "'That,' said Ford quietly, "'is because we don't care enough, I told you.' He swung his feet up on to the instrument-panel, and picked fitfully at something on one of his fingernails. "'But unless we determine to take action,' said the old man querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his nature, "'then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die. Surely we care about that?' "'Yeah, not enough to want to get killed over it,' said Ford. He put on a sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who wanted to see it. Slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive, and he fought against it. He turned again to Zaphod, who was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain. "'You surely must have some idea,' he said, "'of why they spared your life. It seems most strange and unusual.' "'I kind of think they didn't know,' shrugged Zaphod. "'I told you, they hit me with the most feeble blast. Just knocked me out, right? They lugged me under their ship, dumped me in a corner, and ignored me, like they were embarrassed about me being there. If I said anything they'd knock me out again. We had some great conversations. Hey, uh, hi there, uh, I wonder, uh, kept me amused for hours, you know.' He winced again. He was toying with something in his fingers. He held it up. It was the golden bale, the heart of gold, the heart of the infinite improbability drive. Only that and the wooden pillar had survived the destruction of the lock intact. "'I hear your ship can move a bit,' he said. "'So how'd you like to zip me back to mine before you—' "'Will you not help us?' said Slartibartfast. "'Us?' said Ford sharply. Who's us?' "'I'd love to stay and help you save the galaxy,' insisted Zaphod, raising himself up onto his shoulders. But I have the mother and father of a pair of headaches, and I feel a lot of little headaches coming on. But next time we need saving, I'm your guy. Hey, Trillion baby!' She looked around briefly. "'Yes?' "'You want to come, heart of gold? Excitement and adventure and really wild things?' "'I'm going down to Cricket,' she said.
 Chapter XVI. After a disgusting Sunday spent emptying rubbish-bins behind a pub in Taunton, and finding nothing—no raffle-ticket, no telephone-number—Arthur tried everything he could to find Fanchurch, and the more things he tried the more weeks passed. He raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the world and its weather. He even, in his sorrow and his fury, went and sat in the motorway service-station cafeteria where he had been just before he met her. It's the drizzle that makes me particularly morose. "'Please shut up about the drizzle,' snapped Arthur. "'I would shut up if it would shut up drizzling. Look! But I'll tell you what it'll do when it shuts up drizzling, shall I? No—blatter. What? It will blatter!' Arthur stared over the rim of his coffee-cup at the grisly outside world. It was a completely pointless place to be, he realized, and he had driven there by superstition rather than However, as if to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact happen, fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry-driver he had encountered there last time. The more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the man's exasperating conversation. "'I think,' said Arthur vaguely, cursing himself for even bothering to say this, "'that it's easing off.' "'Ha!' Arthur just shrugged. "'He should go. That's what he should do. He should just go.' "'It never stops raining,' ranted the lorry-driver. He thumped the table, spilt his tea, and actually for a moment appeared to be steaming. "'You can't just walk off without responding to a remark like that.' "'Of course it stops raining,' said Arthur. It was hardly an elegant refutation, but it had to be said. "'It rains all the time!' raved the man, thumping the table again in time to the words. "'Stupid to say it rains all the time!' he said. "'The man's eyebrows shot up, affronted. "'Stupid! Why is it stupid? Why is it stupid to say it rains all the time, if it rains the whole time? "'Didn't rain yesterday. Did in Darlington.' "'Are you going to ask me where I was yesterday?' asked the man. "'Eh?' "'No,' said Arthur. "'But I expect you can guess, do you?' "'Yeah. Begins with a D, does it? And it was pissing down there, I can tell you.' "'You don't want to sit there, mate,' said a passing stranger in overalls to Arthur cheerily. "'That's the under-cloud corner, that is. Special reserve for old raindrops keep falling on me head here. There's one reserved in every motorway cap between here and sunny Denmark. Steer clear is my advice. It's what we all do. How's it going, Rob? Keeping busy? Got your wet-weather tyres on? Ha-ha!' He breezed by and went to tell a joke about Briteclum to someone at a nearby table. "'See, none of them bastards take me seriously,' said Rob McKenna. "'But,' he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes, "'they all know it's true.' Arthur frowned. "'Like my wife,' hissed the sole owner and driver of McKenna's all-weather haulage, "'she says it's nonsense and I make a fuss and complain about nothing. But,' he paused dramatically and darted out dangerous looks from his eyes, "'she always brings the washing-in when I'se phone to say I'm on me way home.' He brandished his coffee spoon. "'What do you make of that?' "'Oh, well, I have a book,' he went on. "'I have a book, a diary. Kept it for fifteen years. Shows every single place I've ever been, every day, and also what the weather was like. And it was uniformly,' he snarled, "'horrible. All over England, Scotland, Wales I've been, all round the continent, Italy, Germany, back and forth to Denmark, been to Yugoslavia. It's all marked in and charted. "'Even when I went to visit my brother,' he added, "'in Seattle.' "'Well,' said Arthur, getting up to leave at last, "'perhaps you'd better show it to someone.' "'I will,' said Rob McKenna. And he did.
 Chapter 18 Arthur materialised, and did so with all the customary staggering about and clasping at his throat, heart, and various limbs which he still indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and painful materialisations that he was determined not to let himself get used to. He looked round for the others. They weren't there. He looked round for the others again. They still weren't there. He closed his eyes. He opened them. He looked round for the others. They obstinately persisted in their absence. He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making this completely futile exercise once more, and because it was only then, whilst his eyes were closed, that his brain began to register what his eyes had been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown crept across his face. So he opened his eyes again to check his facts, and the frown stayed put. If anything, it intensified and got a good firm grip. If this was a party, it was a very bad one—so bad, in fact, that everyone else had left. He abandoned this line of thought as futile. Obviously this wasn't a party. It was a cave, or a labyrinth, or a tunnel, or something, that was insufficient light to tell. All was darkness—a damp, shiny darkness. The only sounds were the echoes of his own breathing, which sounded worried. He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to the thin, ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as if to say, Yes? This happened to every slightest noise he made, and it unnerved him. He tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned to him it was a hollow dirge, and he stopped. His mind was suddenly full of images from the story that Slartibartfast had been telling him. He half expected suddenly to see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill him. He caught his breath. They didn't. He let it go again. He didn't know what he did expect. Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign. It said, silently, You have been diverted. The sign flicked off again in a way that Arthur was not at all certain he liked. It flicked off with a sort of contemptuous flourish. Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just a ridiculous trick of his imagination. A neon sign is either on or off, depending on whether it has electricity running through it or not. There was no way, he told himself, that it could possibly affect the transition from one state to the other with a contemptuous flourish. He hugged himself tightly in his dressing-gown and shivered nevertheless. The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up bafflingly with just three dots and a comma, like this, dot, dot, dot, comma, only in green neon. It was trying, Arthur realised, after staring at this perplexedly for a second or two, to indicate that there was more to come, that the sentence was not complete, trying with almost superhuman pedantry, he further reflected, or at least inhuman pedantry. The sentence then completed itself with these two words, Arthur Dent. He reeled. He steadied himself to have another clear look at it. It still said Arthur Dent, so he reeled again. Once again the sign flicked off and left him blinking in the darkness, with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his retina. Welcome, the sign now suddenly said. After a moment it added, I don't think. The stone-cold fear which had been hovering around Arthur all this time, waiting for its moment, recognised that its moment had now come and pounced on him. He tried to fight it off. He dropped into a kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television, but it must have been someone with stronger knees. He peered huntedly into the darkness. Uh, hello? he said. He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and without the uh. At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if someone started to beat on a bass drum. He listened to it for a few seconds and realised that it was just his heart beating. He listened for a few seconds more and realised that it wasn't his heart. It was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass drum. Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves and leapt off. He put out a hand onto the floor to steady his alert crouch, which wasn't holding up very well. The sign changed itself again. It said, Do not be alarmed. After a pause it added, Be very, very frightened, Arthur Dent. Once again it flicked off. Once again it left him in darkness. His eyes seemed to be popping out of his head. He wasn't certain if this was because they were trying to see more clearly or if they simply wanted to leave at this point. Hello? he said again, this time trying to put a note of rugged and aggressive self-assertion into it. Is anyone there? There was no reply. Nothing. This unnerved Arthur even more than a reply would have done and he began to back away from the scary nothingness. And the more he backed away the more scared he became. After a while he realised that the reason for this was because of all the films he had done in which the hero backs further and further away from some imagined terror in front of him only to bump into it coming up from behind. Just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn around rather quickly. There was nothing there, just blackness. This really unnerved him and he started to back away from that, back the way he had come. After doing this for a short while it suddenly occurred to him that he was now backing towards whatever it was he'd been backing away from in the first place. This he couldn't help thinking must be a foolish thing to do. He decided to be better off backing the way he'd first been backing and turned around again. It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the correct one because there was an indescribably hideous monster standing quietly behind him. Arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to jump one way and his skeleton the other whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of. Bet you weren't expecting to see me again, said the monster, which Arthur couldn't help thinking was a strange remark for it to make, seeing that he'd never met the creature before. He could tell that he hadn't met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights. It was—it was— Arthur blinked at it. It stood very still. It did look a little familiar. A terrible cold calm came over him as he realised that what he was looking at was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly. He wondered why anybody would be showing him a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly at this time. He wondered whose voice he had heard. It was a terribly realistic hologram. It vanished. Well, perhaps you remember me better, said the voice suddenly, and it was a deep hollow malevolent voice that sounded like molten tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind. Ask the rabbit! With a sudden ping there was a rabbit there in the black labyrinth with him—a huge, monstrously hideously soft and lovable rabbit—an image again, but one on which every single soft and lovable hair seemed like a real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat. Arthur was startled to see his own reflection in its soft and lovable, unblinking and extremely huge brown eye. Born in darkness, rumbled the voice, raised in darkness, one morning I poked my head out for the first time into the bright new world and got it split open by what felt like some primitive instrument made of flint. Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you. Rather hard, as I recall. You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in. I happened to know that because in my next life I came back as a fly again and you swatted me again, only this time you swatted me with the bag you'd made of my previous skin. Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you are also staggeringly tactless." The voice paused while Arthur gawked. "'I see you have lost the bag,' said the voice. "'Probably got bored with it, did you?' Arthur shook his head helplessly. He wanted to explain that he had been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and had taken it with him wherever he went, but that somehow every time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with the wrong bag, and that curiously enough even as they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at the moment appeared to be made out of a rather nasty fake leopard skin and wasn't the one he'd had a few moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was, and wasn't one he would have chosen himself, and heaven knew what would be in it as it wasn't his, and he'd much rather have his original bag back, except that he was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it or all its component parts, i.e. the rabbit skin, from its previous owner, Viz the Rabbit, whom he currently had the honour of attempting vainly to address. All he actually managed to say was, "'Oop!' "'Meet the newt you trod on,' said the voice, and there was, standing in the corridor with Arthur, a giant green scaly newt. Arthur turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and found himself standing in the middle of the rabbit. He yelped again, but could find nowhere to leap to. "'That was me, too,' continued the voice, in a low menacing rumble. "'As if you didn't know!' "'No,' said Arthur at the start. "'No. The interesting thing about reincarnation,' rasped the voice, "'is that most people, most spirits, are not aware that it is happening to them.' He paused for effect. As far as Arthur was concerned, there was already quite enough effect going on. "'I was aware,' hissed the voice. "'That is, I became aware, slowly, gradually.' He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath. "'I could hardly help it, could I?' he bellowed. "'When the same thing kept happening, over and over and over again. "'Every life I ever lived, I got killed by Arthur Dent. "'Any world, any body, any time. "'I'm just getting settled down. Along comes Arthur Dent. Pow! He kills me. "'Hard not to notice. Bit of a memory jogger. Bit of a pointer. Bit of a bloody giveaway. "'That's funny,' my spirit would say to itself, as it winged its way back to the netherworld "'after another fruitless Dent-end adventure into the land of the living. "'That man who just ran over me as I was hopping across the road to my favourite pond "'looked a little familiar. "'And gradually I got to piece it together, Dent, you multiple me murderer.' The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors. Arthur stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief. "'Here's the moment, Dent!' shrieked the voice, now reaching a feverish pitch of hatred. "'Here's the moment when at last I knew!' "'It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly opened up in front of Arthur, "'making him gasp and gargle with horror. "'But here's an attempt at a description of how hideous it was. "'It was a huge, palpitating, wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale-like creature "'lolling around and sliding over monstrous white tombstones. "'High above the cave rose a vast promontory in which could be seen "'the dark recesses of two further fearful caves which—' Arthur Dent suddenly realised he was looking at his own mouth, when his attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it. He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes. When he looked again the appalling apparition had gone. The corridor was dark and briefly silent. He was alone with his thoughts. They were extremely unpleasant thoughts, and he would rather have had a chaperone. The next noise when it came was the low, heavy roll of a large section of wall trundling aside, revealing for the moment just dark blankness behind it. Arthur looked into it in much the same way that a mouse looks into a dark dog kennel. And the voice spoke to him again. "'Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent,' it said. "'I dare you to tell me it was a coincidence.' "'It was a coincidence,' said Arthur quickly. "'It was not!' came the answering bellow. "'It was,' said Arthur. "'It was. "'If it was a coincidence, then my name,' roared the voice, "'is not Agrajag!' "'And presumably,' said Arthur, "'you would claim that that was your name.' "'Yes!' hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft syllogism. "'Well, I'm afraid it was still a coincidence,' said Arthur. "'Come in here and say that!' howled the voice in a sudden apoplexy again. Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least he nearly said it was a coincidence. His tongue rather lost its footing toward the end of the last word, because the lights came up and revealed what it was he had walked into. "'It was a cathedral of hate. "'It was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but actually sprained. "'It was huge. "'It was horrific. "'It had a statue in it. "'We will come to the statue in a moment. "'The vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been carved out of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was that that was precisely what it had been carved out of. "'It seemed to Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it. "'It was black. "'Where it wasn't black you were inclined to wish that it was, because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours, from ultra-violent to infraded, taking in liver-purple, loathsome lilac, matter-yellow, burnt ombre, and gangrene on the way. "'The unspeakable details that these colours picked out were gargoyles that would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch. "'The gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, from the flying buttresses, from the choir-stalls, toward the statue, to which we will come in a moment. "'And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch, then it was clear from the gargoyles' faces that the statue would have put them off theirs, had they been alive to eat it, which they weren't, and had anybody tried to serve them some, which they wouldn't. "'Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent. "'The names of some of those commemorated were underlined and had asterisks against them. "'So, for instance, the name of a cow that had been slaughtered, and of which Arthur had happened to eat a fillet steak, would have had the plainest engraving, whereas the name of a fish that Arthur had himself caught, and then decided he didn't like, and left on the side of the plate, had a double underlining, three sets of asterisks, and a bleeding dagger added as a decoration, just to make the point. "'And what was most disturbing about all this, apart from the statue, to which we are by degrees coming, was the very clear implication that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person, over and over again. "'And it was equally clear that this person was, however unfairly, extremely upset and annoyed. "'In fact, it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the universe. "'It was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning, searing flame of annoyance, an annoyance that now spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage. "'And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the statue in the centre of all this monstrosity that was a statue of Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one. "'Fifty feet tall, if it was an inch, there was not an inch of it that wasn't crammed with insult to its subject-maker, and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad. "'From the small pimple on the side of his nose, to the poorish cut of his dressing-gown, there was no aspect of Arthur Dent that wasn't lambasted and vilified by the sculptor. "'Arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravening, bloodied ogre, slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man universe. "'With each of the thirty arms that the sculptor, in a fit of artistic fervour, had decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea out of his hair, or doing something that Arthur at first couldn't quite identify. "'His many feet were mostly stamping on ants.' "'Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head, and shook it slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things. "'And when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the figure of the man or creature or whatever it was that he had supposedly been persecuting all this time. "'Aaah!' said Agrajag. He or it or whatever looked like a mad fat bat. He waddled slowly around Arthur and poked at him with bent claws. "'Look!' protested Arthur. "'Aaah!' explained Agrajag, and Arthur reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition. "'Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled, and leathery. "'His bat wings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic, broken, floundering things they were than if they had been strong, muscular beaters of the air. "'The most frightening thing was probably the tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical odds. "'He had the most astounding collection of teeth. "'They looked as if each came from a completely different animal, and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything he'd lacerate half his own face along with it and possibly put out an eye as well. "'Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as sane as a fish in a privet bush. "'I was at a cricket match!' he rasped. "'This seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that Arthur practically choked. "'Not in this body!' screeched the creature. "'Not in this body! "'This is my last body, my last life! "'This is my revenge body, my kill-Arthur-Dent body! "'My last chance! "'I had to fight to get it, too! "'But I was at,' roared Agrajag, "'a cricket match! "'I had a weak heart condition! "'But what,' I said to my wife, "'can happen to me at a cricket match! "'As I'm watching, what happens? "'Two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air that's in front of me. "'The last thing I can't help but notice before my poor heart gives out in shock "'is that one of them is Arthur-Dent, wearing a rabbit bone in his beard. "'Coincidence?' "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'Coincidence!' screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its broken wings and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a particularly nasty tooth. "'On closer examination, such as he'd been hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that "'much of Agrajag's face was covered with ragged strips of black band-aids. "'He backed away nervously. "'He tugged at his beard. "'He was appalled to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it. "'He pulled it out and threw it away. "'Look,' he said, "'it's just fate playing silly buggers with you, with me, with us. "'It's a complete coincidence!' "'What have you got against me, Dent?' snarled the creature, advancing I'm in a painful waddle. "'Nothing,' insisted Arthur, honestly, nothing. "'Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare. "'Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you've got nothing against, "'killing them all the time. "'Very curious piece of social interaction, I would call that. "'I would also call it a lie!' "'But look,' said Arthur, "'I'm very sorry. "'There's been a terrible misunderstanding. "'I've got to go. "'Have you got a clock? "'I'm meant to be helping save the universe.' "'He backed away still farther. "'Agrajag advanced still further. "'At one point,' he hissed, "'at one point I decided to give up. "'Yes, I would not come back. "'I would stay in the netherworld. "'And what happened?' Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no idea, and didn't want to have one either. He found he'd backed up against the cold, dark stone that had been carved by who-knew-what Herculean effort into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers. He glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image towering above him. He was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was meant to be doing. "'I got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world,' pursued Agrajag. "'As a bunch of petunias. "'In, I might add, a bowl. "'This particular happy little lifetime started off with me, "'in my bowl, unsupported, "'three hundred miles above the surface of a particularly grim planet. "'Not a naturally tenable position for a bowl of petunias, you might think. "'And you'd be right. "'That life ended a very short while later, "'three hundred miles lower, "'in, I might again add, "'the fresh wreckage of a whale, my spirit brother.' He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred. "'On the way down,' he snarled, "'I couldn't help noticing a flashy-looking white spaceship. "'And looking out of a port on this flashy-looking spaceship "'was a smug-looking Arthur Dent. "'Coincidence?' "'Yes,' yelped Arthur. "'He glanced up again and realised that the arm that had puzzled him "'was represented as wantonly calling into existence "'a bowl of doomed petunias. "'This was not a concept that leapt easily to the eye.' "'I must go,' insisted Arthur. "'You may go,' said Agrajaic. "'After I have killed you!' "'No, that won't be any use,' explained Arthur, "'beginning to climb up the hard stone incline of his carved bedroom slipper. "'Because I have to save the universe, you see. "'I have to find a silver bale, that's the point. "'A tricky thing to do, dead.' "'Save the universe?' spat Agrajaic with contempt. "'You should have thought of that before you started your vendetta against me. "'What about the time when you were on Stavromula Beta and someone-' "'I've never been there,' said Arthur. "'Tried to assassinate you and you ducked. "'Who do you think that bullet hit? What did you say?' "'Never been there,' repeated Arthur. "'What are you talking about? I have to go.' "'Agrajaic stopped in his tracks. "'You must have been there! "'You were responsible for my death there as everywhere else. "'An innocent bystander!' he quivered. "'I've never heard of the place,' insisted Arthur. "'I've certainly never had anyone try to assassinate me, "'I mean, other than you. "'Perhaps I go there later, do you think?' "'Agrajaic blinked slowly in a kind of frozen, logical horror. "'You haven't been to Stavromula Beta yet?' he whispered. "'No,' said Arthur. "'I don't know anything about the place. "'Certainly never been to it and don't have any plans to go.' "'Oh, you go there, all right!' muttered Agrajaic in a broken voice. "'You go there, all right! Oh, Zark!' he tottered "'and stared wildly about him at his huge cathedral of hate. "'I've brought you here too soon!' he started to scream and bellow. "'I've brought you here too zarking soon!' "'Suddenly he rallied and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur. "'I'm going to kill you anyway!' he roared, "'even if it's a logical impossibility, I'm going to zarking well try! "'I'm going to blow this whole mountain up!' he screamed. "'Let's see you get out of this one, dent!' "'He rushed in a painful, waddling hobble to what appeared to be a small, "'black, sacrificial altar. "'He was shouting so wildly now that he was really carving his face up badly. "'Arthur leapt down from his vantage place on the carving of his own foot "'and ran to try to restrain the three-quarters crazed creature. "'He leapt upon him and brought the strange monstrosity "'crashing down on top of the altar. "'Agrajag screamed again, thrashing wildly for a brief moment, "'and turned a wild eye on Arthur. "'You know what you've done!' he gurgled painfully. "'You've gone and killed me again! "'I mean, what do you want from me, blood?' "'He thrashed again in a brief, apoplectic fit, quivered and collapsed, "'smacking a large, red button on the altar as he did so. "'Arthur started with horror and fear, "'first at what he appeared to have done, "'and then at the loud sirens and bells "'that suddenly shattered the air to announce some clamoring emergency. "'He stared wildly around him. "'The only exit appeared to be the way he'd come in. "'He pelted toward it, throwing away the nasty, fake leopard-skin bag as he did so. "'He dashed randomly, haphazardly, through the labyrinthine maze. "'He seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by klaxons, sirens, flashing lights. "'Suddenly he turned a corner and there was a light in front of him. "'It wasn't flashing. It was daylight.'"
 CHAPTER IV. Whether it was because he was drunk, ill, or suicidally insane would not have been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed there were no casual observers in the old pink dog-bar on the lower south side of Handold City, because it wasn't the sort of place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive. Any observers in the place would have been mean hawk-like observers, heavily armed with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy things when they observed things they didn't like. One of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a sort of missile-crisis sort of hush. Even the evil-looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers, which was a service it provided for free. All eyes were on Ford Prefect. Some of them were on Storks. The particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small defence budget with an American Express card, which was not acceptable anywhere in the known universe. "'What are you worried about?' he asked in a cheery kind of way. "'The expiration date? Have you guys never heard of near-relativity out here? There's a whole new area of physics which can take care of this sort of thing. Time-dilation effects, temporal relistatics—' "'We are not worried about the expiration date,' said the man to whom he addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in a dangerous city. His voice was a low, soft purr like the low, soft purr made by the opening of an icy BM silo. A hand like a side of meat tapped on the bar-top, lightly denting it. "'Well, that's good, then,' said Ford, packing his satchel and preparing to leave. The tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder of Ford Prefect. It prevented him from leaving. Although the finger was attached to a slab-like hand, and the hand was attached to a club-like forearm, the forearm wasn't attached to anything at all, except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached by a fierce dog-like loyalty to the bar which was its home. It had previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner of the bar, who, on his death-bed, had unexpectedly bequeathed it to Medical Science. Medical Science had decided they didn't like the look of it, and had bequeathed it right back to the old pink dog-bar. The new barman didn't believe in this supernatural or poltergeist or anything kooky like that. He just knew a useful ally when he saw one. The hand sat on the bar. It took orders, it served drinks, it dealt murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be murdered. Ford Prefect sat still. "'We are not worried about the expiration date,' repeated the barman, satisfied that he now had Ford Prefect's full attention. "'We are worried about the entire piece of plastic.' "'What?' said Ford. He seemed a little taken aback. "'This,' said the barman, holding out the card, as if it was a small fish whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the land where fish are eternally blessed. "'We don't accept it.' Ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didn't have any other means of payment on him, but decided for the moment to soldier on. The disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb. "'But you don't understand,' said Ford, his expression slowly ripening from a little taken-abackness into rank incredulity. "'This is the American Express card. It is the finest way of settling bills known to man. Haven't you read their junk mail?' The cheery quality of Ford's voice was beginning to grate on the barman's ears. It sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo during one of the more sombre passages of a war requiem. One of the bones in Ford's shoulder began to grate against another one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the hand had learnt the principles of pain from a highly skilled chiropractor. He hoped he could get this business settled before the hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of the bones in different parts of his body. Luckily the shoulder it was holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over. The barman slid the card back across the bar at Ford. "'We have never,' he said with muted savagery, "'heard of this thing.'" This was hardly surprising. Ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error towards the end of the fifteen-year sojourn he had spent on the planet earth. Exactly how serious, the American Express Company had got to know very rapidly, and the increasingly strident and panic-stricken demands of its debt-collection department were only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass. He had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form of currency that no one would accept. "'Credit,' he said. "'Aaaaaaah!' These two words were usually coupled together in the old pink dog-bar. "'I thought,' gasped Ford, "'this was meant to be a class establishment.' He glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps, and record-company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bar's inner recesses were pitted. They were all very deliberately looking in any direction but his now, carefully picking up the threads of their former conversations about murders, drug-rings, and music-publishing deals. They knew what would happen now, and didn't want to watch, in case it put them off their drinks. "'You gonna die, boy,' the barman murmured quietly at Ford Prefect, and the evidence was on his side. The bar used to have one of those signs hanging up which said, "'Please don't ask for credit,' as a punch in the mouth often offends. But in the interest of strict accuracy this was altered to, "'Please don't ask for credit because having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disembodied hand smashes your head against the bar' often offends. However, this made an unreadable mess of the notice, and anyway didn't have the same ring to it, so it was taken down again. It was felt that the story would get about of its own accord, and it had. "'Let me look at the bill again,' said Ford. He picked it up and studded it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman, and the equally malevolent gaze of the bird, which was currently gouging great furrows in the bar-top with its talons. It was a rather lengthy piece of paper. At the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always take so long to copy on to the registration form. He had, after all, been in the bar all day. He had been drinking a lot of stuff with bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the pimps, thugs, and record executives, who suddenly couldn't remember who he was. He cleared his throat rather quietly, and patted his pockets. There was, as he knew, nothing in them. He rested his left hand lightly but firmly on the half-opened flap of his satchel. The disembodied hand renewed its pressure on his right shoulder. "'You see,' said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly in front of Ford's, "'I have a reputation to think of. You see that, don't you?' This is it,' thought Ford. There was nothing else for it. He had obeyed the rules. He had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill. It had been rejected. He was now in danger of his life. "'Well,' he said quietly, "'if it's your reputation!' With a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped down on the bar-top his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the official card which said that he was a field-researcher for the Guide, and absolutely not allowed to do what he was now doing. "'Want a write-up?' The barman's face stopped in mid-wobble. The bird's talons stopped in mid-furrow. The hand slowly released its grip. "'That,' said the barman, in a barely audible whisper from between dry lips, "'will do nicely, sir.'"
 Chapter 18 A Summer's Day in Islington, full of the mournful wail of antique-restoring machinery. Fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so Arthur wandered in a blist'out haze, and looked at all the shops, which in Islington are quite a useful bunch, as anyone who regularly needs old woodworking tools, bow or helmets, drag, office furniture, or fish, will readily confirm. The sun beat down over the roof-gardens, it beat on architects and plumbers, it beat on barristers and burglars, it beat on pizzas, it beat on estate agents' particulars. It beat on Arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop. "'It's an interesting building,' said the proprietor cheerfully. "'There's a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby pub. It was built for the Prince Regent, apparently, so he could make his escape when he needed to.' "'You mean in case anyone might catch him buying strip-pine furniture?' said Arthur. "'No,' said the proprietor, "'not for that reason.' "'You'll have to excuse me,' said Arthur. "'I'm terribly happy.' "'I see.' He wandered hazily on, and found himself outside the offices of Greenpeace. He remembered the contents of his file, marked, Things to Do, Urgent, which he hadn't opened again in the meantime. He marched in with a cheery smile, and said he'd come to give them some money to help free the dolphins. "'Very funny,' they told him. "'Go away.' This wasn't quite the response he'd expected, so he tried again. This time they got quite angry with him, so he just left some money anyway, and went back out into the sunshine. Just after six he returned to Fenchurch's house in the alleyway, clutching a bottle of champagne. "'Hold this,' she said, shoved a stout rope in his hands, and disappeared inside the large white wooden doors from which dangled a fat padlock of a black iron bar. The house was a small converted stable in a light industrial alleyway behind the derelict Royal Agricultural Hall of Islington. As well as its large stable doors, it also had a normal-looking front door of smartly glazed panelled wood, with a black dolphin door-knocker. The one odd thing about this door was its doorstep, which was nine feet high, since the door was set into the upper of the two floors, and presumably had been originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses. An old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway, and it was over this that the rope Arthur was holding was slung. The other end of the rope held a suspended cello. The door opened above his head. "'Okay,' said Fenchurch. "'Pull on the rope, steady the cello, pass it up to me.' He pulled on the rope, he steadied the cello. "'I can't pull on the rope again,' he said, without letting go of the cello. Fenchurch leant down. "'I'm steadying the cello,' she said. '...you pull on the rope.' The cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly, and Fenchurch manoeuvred it inside. "'Come on up yourself,' she called down. Arthur picked up his bag of goodies, and went in through the stable doors, tingling. The bottom room, which he had seen briefly before, was pretty rough and full of junk. A large old cast-iron mangle stood there. A surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner. There was also, Arthur was momentarily alarmed to see, a pram, but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books. The floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked, and this was the measure of Arthur's mood as he started up the rickety wooden steps in the far corner. Even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him an almost unbearably sensual thing. "'An architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do wonderful things with this place,' said Fenchurch, chatterly, as Arthur emerged through the floor. "'He keeps on coming round, standing in stunned amazement, muttering about space and objects and events and marvellous qualities of light, then says he needs a pencil and disappears for weeks. Wonderful things have therefore so far failed to happen.' In fact, thought Arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at least reasonably wonderful anyway. It was simply decorated, furnished with things made out of cushions, and also a stereo set with speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up Stonehenge. There were flowers which were pale, and pictures which were interesting. There was a sort of gallery structure in the roof-space which held a bed and also a bathroom which, Fenchurch explained, you could actually swing a cat in, but, she added, only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didn't mind a few nasty cracks about the head. So here you are.' "'Yes.' They looked at each other for a moment. The moment became a longer moment, and suddenly it was a very long moment, so long one could hardly tell where all the time was coming from. For Arthur, who could usually contrive to feel self-conscious if left alone for long enough with a Swiss cheese-plant, the moment was one of sustained revelation. He felt on the sudden like a cramped and zoo-born animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his cage hanging quietly open, and the savannah stretching grey and pink to the distant rising sun, while all around new sounds are waking. He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly wandering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise. He hadn't realised that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had never consciously detected it or recognised its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before, which was, yes.' Fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last with a tiny shake of her head. "'I know,' she said. "'I shall have to remember,' she added, 'that you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it.' She turned away. "'Let's go for a walk,' she said quickly. "'Hyde Park. I'll change into something less suitable.' She was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly shapely one, and it didn't really suit her. "'I wear it especially for my cello teacher,' she said. "'He's a nice old boy, but I sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited. I'll be down in a minute.' She ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called down, "'Put the bottle in the fridge for later.' He noticed, as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door, that it had an identical twin to sit next to. He walked over to the window and looked out. He turned and started to look at her records. From above he heard the rustle of her dress falling to the ground. He talked to himself about the sort of person he was. He told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on the spines of her records, read the titles, nod appreciatively, count the blasted things if he had to. He would keep his head down. This he completely, utterly, and abjectly failed to do. She was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed hardly to notice that he was looking up at her. Then suddenly she shook her head, dropped the light sundress down over herself, and disappeared quickly into the bathroom. She emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sun-hat, and came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness. It was a strange kind of dancing motion she had. She saw that he noticed it, and put her head slightly on one side. "'Like it?' she said. "'You look gorgeous,' he said simply, because she did. "'H'm,' she said, as if he hadn't really answered her question. She closed the upstairs front door, which had stood open all this time, and looked round the little room to see that it was all in a fit state to be left on its own for a while. Arthur's eyes followed hers around, and while he was looking in the other direction she slipped something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying. Arthur looked back at her. "'Ready?' "'Did you know,' she said with a slightly puzzled smile, "'that there's something wrong with me?' Her directness caught Arthur unprepared. "'Well,' he said, "'I'd heard some vague sort of—' "'I wonder how much you do know about me,' she said. "'If you heard from where I think you heard, then that's not it. People just sort of make stuff up, because you can't deal with what it really is.' A pang of worry went through Arthur. "'Then what is it?' he said. "'Can you tell me?' "'Don't worry,' she said. "'It's nothing bad at all. Just unusual—very, very unusual.' She touched his hand, then leant forward and kissed him briefly. "'I should be very interested to know,' she said, "'if you manage to work out what it is this evening.' Arthur felt that if someone had tapped him at that point he would have chimed, like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fish-boil made when he flicked it with his thumbnail.
 Chapter 1. That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of year. It was cold and windy, which was normal. It started to rain, which was particularly normal. A spacecraft landed, which was not. There was nobody around to see it except for some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds, who hadn't the faintest idea what to make of it, and whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what. So they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other, which never worked. It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single beam of light. From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close too, it was strangely beautiful, a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form, quite small. Of course one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take the findings of the latest mid-galactic census report as any kind of accurate guide to statistical averages, you would probably guess that the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right. You would probably guess that anyway. The census report, like most surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn't tell anybody anything they didn't already know, except that every single person in the galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena. Since this is clearly not true, the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped. The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbows. It hummed very quietly, a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground, and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb. At last it dropped and was quiet. A hatchway opened. A short flight of steps unfolded itself. A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into the wet night, and shadows moved within. A tall figure appeared in the light, looked round, flinched, and hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its arm. It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back to the ship. Already the rain was streaming through its hair. "'Thank you,' he called out. "'Thank you very—' He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder. He glanced up apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom. It had large characters printed on the side, which read—to anyone who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet—'Duty Free Mega Market, Port Brasta, Alpha Centauri. Be like the twenty-second elephant with heated value in space. Bark!' "'Hold on!' the figure called, waving at the ship. The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway, stopped, re-unfolded, and allowed him back in. He emerged again a few seconds later, carrying a battered and threadbare towel, which he shoved into the bag. He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run for the shelter of some trees, as behind him the spacecraft had already begun its ascent. Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a wide berth. He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with ever-increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky. His feet sloshed through the mud. Thunder grumbled over the hills. He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on. More lights. Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded. The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his steps, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they had appeared. And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle. The figure paused to examine the barrier, and then dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over himself. Instinctively had the figure touch the ground on the other side, when they came sweeping out of the rain towards him, a machine, light-streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as the machine streaked towards him. It was a low, bulbous shape, like a small whale surfing, sleek, grey and rounded, and moving at terrifying speed. The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night. It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split second to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared. To the figure's apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, My other car is also a Porsche.
 Chapter XXVII. It was the same hill, and yet not the same. This time it was not an informational illusion. This was cricket itself, and they were standing on it. Near them, behind the trees, stood the strange Italian restaurant that had brought these, their real bodies, to this, the real, present world of cricket. The strong grass under their feet was real, the rich soil real, too, the heady fragrances from the tree, too, were real. The night was real night. Cricket—possibly the most dangerous place in the galaxy for anyone who isn't a cricketer to stand. The place that could not countenance the existence of any other place, whose charming, delightful, intelligent inhabitants would howl with fear, savagery, and murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own. Arthur shuddered. Slotty Bartfast shuddered. Ford, surprisingly, shuddered. It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was surprising that he was there at all. But when they had returned Zaphod to his ship, Ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away. Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong, wrong, wrong. He hugged to himself one of the zap-guns with which they had armed themselves out of Zaphod's armoury. Trillian shuddered and frowned as she looked into the sky. This, too, was not the same. It was no longer blank and empty. While the countryside around them had changed little in the two thousand years of the cricket wars, and the mere five years that had elapsed locally since cricket was sealed in its slow time-envelope ten billion years ago, the sky was dramatically different. Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it. High in the sky, where no cricketer ever looked, were the war-zones, the robot-zones, huge warships and tower-blocks floating in the nillograv fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface of cricket. Trillian stared at them and thought. "'Trillian,' whispered Ford Prefect to her. "'Yes?' she said. "'What are you doing?' "'Thinking.' "'Do you always breathe like that when you're thinking?' "'I wasn't aware that I was breathing. That's what worried me.' "'I think I know,' said Trillian. "'Shh!' said Slottibart fast an alarm, and his thin trembling hand motioned them farther back beneath the shadow of the tree. Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights coming along the hill-path. But this time the dancing beams were not from lanterns, but flashlights. It was not in itself a dramatic change, but every detail made their hearts thump with fear. This time there were no lilting, whimsical songs about flowers and farming and dead dogs, but hushed voices in urgent debate. A light moved in the sky with slow weight. Arthur was clenched with claustrophobic terror, and the warm wind caught at his throat. Within seconds a second party became visible, approaching from the other side of the dark hill. They were moving swiftly and purposefully, their flashlights swinging and probing around them. The parties were clearly converging, and not merely with each other. They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur and the others were standing. Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his zap-gun to his shoulder, and the slight whimpering cough as Slartibartfast raised his. He felt the cold unfamiliar weight of his own gun, and with shaking hands he raised it. His fingers fumbled to release the safety-catch, and engaged the extreme danger-catch, as Ford had shown him. He was shaking so much that if he had fired at anybody at that moment he probably would have burnt his signature on them. Only Trillian didn't raise her gun. She raised her eyebrows, lowered them again, and bit her lip in thought. "'Has it occurred to you?' she began, but nobody wanted to discuss anything much at the moment. A light stabbed through the darkness from behind them, and they spun round to find a third party of cricketers behind them, searching them out with their flashlights. Ford Prefect's gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back at it and it crashed from his hands. There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen second before anyone fired again, and at the end of the second nobody fired. They were surrounded by pale-faced cricketers and bathed in bobbing torchlight. The captives stared at their captors. The captors stared at their captives. "'Hello,' said one of the captors. "'Excuse me, but are you aliens?'
 Chapter 5. Important Facts from Galactic History, No. 2. Reproduced from the Sidereal Daily Mentioner's Book of Popular Galactic History. Since this galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and fallen, risen and fallen, risen and fallen so often that it's quite tempting to think that life in the galaxy must be a. something akin to seasick, space sick, time sick, history sick, or some such thing, and b. stupid. So, what is it that we are looking for? Well, it's a question of how we can find it.

 Chapter 10 The Body of Arthur Dent Span The universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it, and each particular shard spanned silently through the void, reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction. And then the blackness behind the universe exploded, and each particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell. And the nothingness behind the blackness behind the universe erupted, and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the shattered universe was at last the dark figure of an immense man speaking immense words. "'These, then,' said the figure, speaking from an immensely comfortable chair, "'were the cricket wars, the greatest devastation ever visited upon our galaxy. What you have experienced—' Slarty Bartfast floated past, waving. "'It's just a documentary,' he called out. "'This is not a good bit. Terribly sorry. Trying to find the rewind control. "'Is what billions upon billions of innocent—' "'Do not,' called out Slarty Bartfast, floating past again and fiddling furiously with the thing that had stuck into the wall of the Room of Informational Illusions, and which was in fact still stuck there, '—agree to buy anything at this point. "'People, creatures, your fellow-beings—' The music swelled. Again it was immense music, immense chords, and behind the man slowly three tall pillars began to emerge out of the immensely swirling mist. "'Experienced, lived through, or more often failed to live through. Think of that, my friends, and let us not forget, and in just a moment I shall be able to suggest a way which will help us always to remember, that before the cricket wars the galaxy was that rare and wonderful thing—a happy galaxy.' The music was going bananas with the immensity at this point. "'A happy galaxy, my friend, as represented by the symbol of the Wicket Gate.' The three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped with two cross-pieces, in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to Arthur's addled brain. "'The three pillars,' thundered the man, "'the steel pillar which represented the strength and power of the galaxy.' Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the pillar on the left, which was clearly made of steel or something very like it. The music thumped and bellowed. "'The perspex pillar,' announced the man, "'representing the forces of science and reason in the galaxy.' Other searchlights played exotically up and down the right-hand transparent pillar, creating dazzling patterns within it, and a sudden inexplicable craving for ice-cream in the stomach of Arthur Dent. "'And,' the thunderous voice continued, "'the wooden pillar, representing'—and here his voice became just very slightly hoarse with wonderful sentiments—'the forces of nature and spirituality.' The lights picked out the central pillar, and music moved bravely up into the realms of complete unspeakability. "'Between them supporting,' the voice rolled on, approaching its climax, "'the golden bale of prosperity and the silver bale of peace.' The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the music had now, fortunately, gone far beyond the limits of the discernible. At the top of the three pillars, the two brilliantly gleaming bales sat and dazzled. There seemed to be girls sitting on top of them, and maybe they were meant to be angels—angels are usually represented as wearing more than that, though. Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was presumably meant to be the cosmos, and a darkening of the lights. "'There is not a world,' thrilled the man's expert voice, "'not a civilized world in the galaxy where this symbol is not revered even today. Even in primitive worlds it persists in racial memories. This is what the forces of cricket destroyed, and this it is that now locks their world away till the end of eternity.' And with a flourish the man produced in his hands a model of the Wicket-Gate. Scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must have been about three feet high. "'Not the original key, of course. That, as everyone knows, was destroyed, blasted into the ever-whirling eddies of the space-time continuum, and lost forever. This is a remarkable replica, hand-tooled by skilled craftsmen, lovingly assembled using ancient craft secrets, into a memento you will be proud to own, in memory of those who fell, and in tribute to the galaxy—our galaxy—which they died to defend.' Slarty Bartfast floated past again at this moment. "'Found it,' he said. "'We can lose all this rubbish. Just don't nod, that's all.' "'Now let us all bow our heads in payment,' intoned the voice, and then said it again, much faster and backwards. Lights came and went. The pillars disappeared. The man gaveled himself backwards into nothing. The universe snappily reassembled itself around them. "'You get the gist,' said Slarty Bartfast. "'I'm astonished,' said Arthur, and bewildered. "'I was asleep,' said Ford, who floated into view at this point. Did I miss anything?' They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the edges of an agonizingly high cliff. The wind whipped out from their faces, and across a bay on which the remains of one of the greatest and most powerful space battle-fleets ever assembled in the galaxy was briskly burning itself back into existence. The sky was a sullen pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to blue and upwards to black. Smoke billowed down out of it at an incredible lick. Events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be distinguished, and when, a short while later, a huge star battleship rushed away from them as if they'd said, "'Boo!' they only just recognized it as the point at which they'd come in. But now things were too rapid, a videotactile blur which brushed and jiggled them through centuries of galactic history, turning, twisting, flickering. The sound was a mere thin trill. Periodically throughout the thickening jumble of events they sensed appalling catastrophes, deep horrors, cataclysmic shocks, and these were always associated with certain recurring images, the only images which ever stood out clearly from the avalanche of tumbling history. A wicked gate, a small hard red ball, hard white robots, and also something less distinct, something dark and cloudy. There was also another sensation which rose clearly out of the trilling passage of time. Just as the slow series of clicks, when speeded up, will lose the definition of each individual click, and gradually take on the quality of a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion, and yet not an emotion. If it was an emotion, it was a totally emotionless thing. It was hatred, implacable hatred. It was cold, not like ice is cold, but like a wall is cold. It was impersonal, not like a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a computer-issued parking summons is impersonal. And it was deadly, again not like a bullet or a knife is deadly, but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly. And just as a rising tone will change in character and take on harmonics as it rises, so again this emotionless emotion seemed to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream, and suddenly seemed to be a scream of guilt and failure, and suddenly it stopped. They were left standing on a quiet hill-top on a tranquil evening. The sun was setting. All around them softly undulating green countryside rolled off gently into the distance. Birds sang about what they thought of it all, and general opinion seemed to be good. A little way away could be heard the sound of children playing, and a little further away than the apparent source of that sound could be seen in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town. The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made of white stone. The skyline was of gentle, pleasing curves. The sun had nearly set. As if out of nowhere, music began. A voice said, This! Slartibartfast tugged at a switch, and it stopped. I will tell you about it, he said quietly. The place was peaceful. Arthur felt happy. Even Ford seemed cheerful. They walked a short way in the direction of the town, and the informational illusion of the grass was pleasant and springy under their feet, and the informational illusion of the flowers smelt sweet and fragrant. Slightly slartibartfast seemed apprehensive and out of sorts. He stopped and looked up. It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this did, at the end, so to speak, or rather the beginning, of all the horror they had just blurrily experienced, something nasty must be about to happen. He was distressed to think that something nasty could happen to somewhere as idyllic as this. He, too, glanced up. There was nothing in the sky. They're not about to attack here, are they? he said. He realized that this was merely a recording he was walking through, but he still felt alarmed. Nothing is about to attack here, said Slartibartfast in a voice which unexpectedly trembled with emotion. This is where it all starts. This is the place itself. This is cricket. He stared up into the sky. The sky, from one horizon to another, from east to west, from north to south, was utterly and completely black.
 Chapter 3 Does anyone have a cattle? Arthur asked as he wandered on to the bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was kicking it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision-screen. He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to them. Hello! he said. At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble surfaces that contained the instruments that controlled the conventional photon drive. They materialised beneath his hands and he flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he pressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again. Something up, said Arthur. Hey, did you hear that? muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls on the infinite Improbability Drive. The monkey spoke. The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut out. Pure history, man, said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability Drive. A talking monkey! Look, if you're upset about something, said Arthur. Phogons, snapped Ford. We're under attack! Arthur gibbered. Well, what are you doing? Let's get out of here. Can't. Computer's jammed. Jammed? It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere in the ship. Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across his forehead, and slumped back against the wall. Nothing we can do, he said. He glared at nothing and bit his lip. When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the earth had been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at all good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in important matches. Whenever this happened he used to experience a peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment. A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow. He started to speak and stopped. He started to speak again and stopped again. Finally he managed to speak. "'Er,' he said. He cleared his throat. "'Tell me,' he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow blob on the vision-screen. "'Tell me,' he said again, "'did the computer say what was occupying it? I just ask out of interest.' Their eyes were riveted on him. "'And, er, well, that's it really. Just asking.' The computer put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck. "'What have you done to it, monkey-man?' he breathed. "'Well,' said Arthur, "'nothing, in fact. It's just that I think a short while ago it was trying to work out how to, er, yes, make me some tea.' "'That's right, guys,' the computer sang out suddenly. "'Just coping with that problem right now. And, wow, it's a biggie. Be with you in a while.' It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent. As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing. The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside the inch-thick force-shield around it blistered, crackled, and spat under the barrage of a dozen thirty-megahert definite-kill Fotrazon cannon and looked as if it wouldn't be around for long. Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect gave it. "'Three minutes and fifty seconds,' he said a short while later. "'Forty-five seconds,' he added at the appropriate time. He flicked idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an unfriendly look. "'Dying for a cup of tea, eh?' he said. "'Three minutes and forty seconds.' "'Will you stop counting?' snarled Zaphod. "'Yes,' said Ford Prefect. "'In three minutes and thirty-five seconds.' Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnik Vogonjeltz was puzzled. He had expected a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor-beams, he had expected to have to use the specially installed sub-cyclic normality assertitron to counter the Heart of Gold's infinite improbability drive, but the sub-cyclic normality assertitron lay idle as the Heart of Gold just sat there and took it. A dozen thirty-megahertz definite-kill Photrazon cannon continued to blaze away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and took it. He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found. He didn't know about the tea, of course. Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Heart of Gold were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they had left to spend." Quite how Zephod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a séance at this point is something he was never quite clear on. Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as something to be avoided than harped upon. Possibly the horror that Zephod experienced at the prospect of being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the same way about him, and, what's more, be able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion. Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the Galaxy. "'You want to talk to your great-grandfather?' boggled Ford. "'Yes.' "'Does it have to be now?' The ship continued to shake and thunder. The temperature was rising, the light was getting dimmer, all the energy the computer didn't require for thinking about tea was being pumped into the rapidly fading force-field. "'Yes,' insisted Zephod. "'Listen, Ford, I think he may be able to help us.' "'Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care.' "'Well, suggest something else we can do.' "'Well—' "'Well—' "'Okay. Around the central console. Now, come on. Trillion, Monkey-Man, move!' They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down, and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held hands. With his third hand Zephod turned off the lights. Darkness gripped the ship. Outside the thunderous roar of the definite keel cannon continued to rip at the force-field. "'Concentrate,' said Zephod, on his name. "'What is it?' said Arthur. "'Zephod Beeblebrox the Fourth.' "'What?' "'Zephod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate.' "'The Fourth?' "'Yes, listen. I'm Zephod Beeblebrox. My father was Zephod Beeblebrox the Second. My grandfather Zephod Beeblebrox the Third.' "'What?' "'There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time-machine. Now concentrate!' "'Three minutes,' said Ford Prefect. "'Why,' said Arthur Dent, "'are we doing this?' "'Shut up!' suggested Zephod Beeblebrox. Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say?" The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner, where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped, ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own. Round the central console four figures hunched in tight concentration, trying to blot from their minds the terrifying shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it. They concentrated. Still they concentrated. And still they concentrated. The seconds ticked by. On Zephod's brows stood beads of sweat, first of concentration, then of frustration, and finally of embarrassment. At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from Trillian and Ford, and stabbed at the light switch. "'Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn the lights on,' said a voice. "'No, not too bright, please. My eyes aren't what they once were.' Four figures jolted upright in their seats. Slowly they turned their heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the same place. "'Now, who disturbs me at this time?' said the small, bent, gaunt figure, standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge. His two small, wispy-haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim memories of the birth of the galaxies themselves. One lulled in sleep, the other squinted sharply at them. If his eyes weren't what they once were, they must once have been diamond-cutters.' Zephod stuttered nervously for a moment. He gave the intricate little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusean gesture of familial respect. "'Oh, hi, great-grandad!' he breathed. The little old figure moved closer towards them. He peered through the dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great-grandson. "'Ah!' he snapped. "'Zephod Beeblebrox, the last of our great line. Zephod Beeblebrox, the nothingth.' "'The first.' "'The nothingth,' spat the figure. Zephod hated his voice. It always seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul. He shifted awkwardly in his seat. "'Er, yeah,' he muttered. "'Look, I'm really sorry about the flowers. I'm going to send them along. But you know the shop was fresh out of reeds and—' "'You forgot!' snapped Zephod Beeblebrox the fourth. "'Well, too busy. Never think of other people. The living are all the same.' Two minutes Zephod whispered forward in an awed whisper. Zephod fidgeted nervously. "'Yeah, but I did mean to send them,' he said. "'And I'll write to my great-grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this.' "'Your great-grandmother?' mused the gaunt little figure to himself. "'Yeah,' said Zephod. "'How is she? Tell you what, I'll go and see her. But first, you know, we've got to—' "'Your late great-grandmother and I are very well,' rasped Zephod Beeblebrox the fourth. "'Ah, oh! But very disappointed in you, young Zephod. "'Er, yeah, well—' Zephod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this conversation, and Ford's heavy breathing at his side told him that the seconds were ticking away fast. The noise and the shaking had reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and Arthur's faces white and unblinking in the gloom. "'Er, great-grandfather, we've been following your progress with considerable despondency. Yeah, look, just at the moment, you see—not to say contempt. Look, could you sort of listen for a moment? I mean, what exactly are you doing with your life?' "'I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet!' cried Zephod. It was an exaggeration, but it was his only opportunity so far of getting the basic point of the exercise across. "'Doesn't surprise me in the least,' said the little old figure with a shrug. "'Only it's happening right now, you see,' insisted Zephod feverishly. The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had brought in, and looked at it with great interest. "'Er, great-grandad!' "'Did you know,' interrupted the ghostly figure, fixing Zephod with a stern look, "'that Beetlejuice Five has now developed a very slight eccentricity in its orbit?' Zephod didn't, and found the information hard to concentrate on, what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on. "'Er, no, look,' he said. "'Me spinning in my grave!' barked the ancestor. He slammed the cup down and pointed a quivering, stick-like, see-through finger at Zephod. "'Your fault!' he screeched. "'One minute thirty,' muttered Ford, his head in his hands. "'Yeah, look, great-grandad, can he actually help, because—' "'Help!' exclaimed the old man, as if he'd been asked for a stoat. "'Yeah, help, and like now, because otherwise—' "'Help!' repeated the old man, as if he'd been asked for a lightly grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed. "'You go swanning your way round the galaxy with your—' The ancestor waved a contemptuous hand. "'With your disreputable friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave. Plastic ones would have done, would have been quite appropriate from you, but no, too busy, too modern, too sceptical, till you suddenly find yourself in a bit of a fix, and come over suddenly all astrally-minded.' He shook his head, carefully so as not to disturb the slumber of the other one, which was already becoming restive. "'Well, I don't know, young Zephod,' he continued. "'I think I'll have to think about this one.' "'One minute ten,' said Ford, hollily. Zephod Beeblebrox IV peered at him curiously. "'Why does that man keep talking in numbers?' he said. "'Those numbers,' said Zephod tersely, "'are the time we've got left to live.' "'Oh,' said his great-grandfather. He grunted to himself. "'Doesn't apply to me, of course,' he said, and moved off to a dimmer recess of the bridge, in search of something else to poke around at. Zephod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness, and wondered if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it. "'Great-grandfather,' he said, "'it applies to us. We are still alive, and we're about to lose our lives.' "'Good job, too.' "'What?' "'What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you've made of it, the phrase pig's-ear comes irresistibly to mind.' "'But I was president of the galaxy, man!' muttered his ancestor. "'What kind of job is that for a beeble-brox?' "'Hey, what? Only president, you know, of the whole galaxy!' Conceited little mega-puppy!' Zephod blinked in bewilderment. "'Hey, what are you at, man? I mean, great-grandfather!' The hunched-up little figure stalked up to his great-grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding Zephod that he was talking to a ghost, because he didn't feel a thing. "'You know, and I know, what being president means, young Zephod. You know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead. And it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have a saying up here, life is wasted on the living.' "'Yeah,' said Zephod bitterly. "'Very good, very deep. Right now I need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads.' "'Fifty seconds,' grunted Ford Prefect. "'Where was I?' said Zephod Beeblebrox the Fourth. "'Pontificating,' said Zephod Beeblebrox. "'Oh, yes.' "'Can this guy,' muttered Ford quietly to Zephod, "'actually in fact help us?' "'Nobody else can,' whispered Zephod.' Ford nodded despondently. "'Zephod,' the ghost was saying, "'you became president of the galaxy for a reason. Have you forgotten? "'Could we go into this later?' "'Have you forgotten?' insisted the ghost. "'Yeah, of course I forgot. I had to forget. "'They screen your brain when you get the job, you know. "'If they'd find my head full of tricksy ideas, "'I'd have been right out on the streets again "'with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial staff, "'a fleet of ships and a couple of slit-throats.' "'Ah,' muttered the ghost in satisfaction. "'Then you do remember.' He paused for a moment. "'Good,' he said, and the noise stopped. "'48 seconds,' said Ford. He looked again at his watch and tapped it. He looked up. "'Hey, the noise has stopped,' he said. A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes. "'I've slowed down time for a moment,' he said. "'Just for a moment, you understand. "'I would hate you to miss all that I have to say.' "'Now listen to me, you see-through old bat,' said Zaphod, leaping out of his chair. "'A, thanks for stopping time and all that. "'Great, terrific, but wonderful. "'But B, no thanks for the homily, right? "'I don't know what this great thing I'm going to be doing is, "'and it looks to me as if I wasn't meant to know, "'and I resent that, right? "'The old me knew, the old me cared. "'Fine, so far, so hoopy, "'except that the old me cared so much "'that he actually got inside his own brain, my own brain, "'and locked off the bits that knew and cared, "'because if I knew and cared, I wouldn't be able to do it. "'I wouldn't be able to go and be president, "'and I wouldn't be able to steal the ship, "'which must be the important thing. "'But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't he, "'by changing my brain. "'Okay, that was his choice. "'This new me has its own choices to make, "'and by a strange coincidence, "'those choices involve not knowing "'and not caring about this big number, whatever it is. "'That's what he wanted, that's what he got. "'Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control, "'leaving orders for me and the bit of my brain he locked off. "'Well, I don't want to know, and I don't want to hear them. "'That's my choice. "'I'm not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my own.' "'Zaphod banged on the console in fury, "'oblivious of the dumbfounded looks he was attracting. "'The old me is dead!' he raved. "'Killed himself! "'The dead shouldn't hang around trying to interfere with the living. "'And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape,' said the ghost. "'Ah!' said Zaphod, sitting down again. "'Well, that's different, isn't it?' "'He grinned a trillion weakly. "'Zaphod,' rasped the apparition, "'I think the only reason I waste my breath on you is that being dead, "'I don't have any other use for it.' "'Okay,' said Zaphod. "'Why don't you tell me what the big secret is? Try me.' "'Zaphod, you knew when you were president of the galaxy, "'as did Euden Vranckx before you, that the president is nothing, a cipher. "'Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, a being, something with ultimate power. "'That man or being or something, you must find the man who controls this galaxy, "'and we suspect others, possibly the entire universe.' "'Why? Why?' exclaimed an astonished ghost. "'Why? Look around you, lad. Does it look to you as if it's in very good hands?' "'Well, it's all right.' "'The old ghost glowered at him. "'I will not argue with you. "'You will simply take this ship, this improbability-drive ship, to where it is needed. "'You will do it. "'Don't think you can escape your purpose. "'The improbability-field controls you. You are in its grip. What's this?' "'He was standing, tapping at one of the terminals of Eddie the shipboard-computer,' Zaphod told him. "'What's it doing?' "'It is trying,' said Zaphod, with wonderful restraint, "'to make tea.' "'Good,' said his great-grandfather. "'I approve of that. "'Now, Zaphod,' he said, turning and wagging a finger at him, "'I don't know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job. "'I think you will not be able to avoid it. "'However, I am too long dead and too tired to care as much as I did. "'The principal reason I am helping you now "'is that I couldn't bear the thought of you and your modern friends slouching about up here. "'Understood?' "'Oh, yeah. Thanks a bundle.' "'Oh, and Zaphod?' "'Oh, yeah?' "'If you ever find you need help again, "'you know, if you're in trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner...' "'Yeah?' "'Please don't hesitate to get lost.' Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the wizened old ghost's hands to the computer. The ghost vanished, the bridge filled with billowing smoke, and the heart of gold leapt an unknown distance through the dimensions of time and space.
 Chapter 1. The regular early-morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was. It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was damp and smelly, it was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington, and there wasn't a bus due for two million years. Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal. At least being lost in space kept you busy. He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the galaxy than he had ever dreamt existed, and though life had now turned very, very, very quiet he was still feeling jumpy. He hadn't been blown up now for five years. Since he had hardly seen anyone since he and Ford Prefect had parted company four years previously he hadn't been insulted in all that time either, except just once. It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously. He was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds. He turned and stared, with hope suddenly clambering through his heart. Rescue! Escape! The Castaway's impossible dream! A ship! And, as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. It alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had generated died away as if lulled by the evening calm. A ramp extended itself. Light streamed out. A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway. It walked down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur. You're a jerk, Dent, it said simply. It was alien, very alien. It had a peculiar alien tallness, a peculiar alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes, extravagantly draped golden robes with a peculiarly alien collar design, and pale grey-green alien skin which had about it that lustrous sheen which most grey-green races can only acquire with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap. Arthur boggled at it. It gazed levelly at him. Arthur's first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use of his vocal cords at this moment. Wh-? he said. B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b Arthur Philip Dent pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap. Uh, uh, yes! Uh, confirmed Arthur. You're a jerk, repeated the alien, a complete arsehole. Uh, the creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard, and turned briskly back towards its ship. Uh, said Arthur desperately. Uh. Don't give me that, snapped the alien. It marched up the ramp, through the hatchway, and disappeared into its ship. The ship sealed itself. It started to make a low, throbbing hum. Uh, hey! shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards it. Wait a minute, he called. What is this? What? Wait a minute! The ship rose as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground, and hovered briefly. It swept strangely up into the evening sky. It passed up through the clouds, illuminating them briefly, and then was gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity of land, dancing a helplessly tiny little dance. What? he screamed. What? What? Hey, what? Come back here and say that! He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his lungs rasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no one to hear him or speak to him. The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the universe from each other. Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back in its single seat. His name was Waubagger the infinitely prolonged. He was a man with a purpose. Not a very good purpose, as he would have been the first to admit, but it was at least a purpose, and it did at least keep him on the move. Waubagger the infinitely prolonged was, indeed is, one of the universe's very small number of immortal beings. Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but Waubagger was not one of them. Indeed, he had come to hate them, the load of serene bastards. He had had his immortality inadvertently thrust upon him, by an unfortunate accident, with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch, and a pair of rubber bands. The precise details of the accident are not important, because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, or both, trying. Waubagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put some light jazz on the ship's stereo, and reflected that he could have made it if it hadn't been for the Sunday afternoons. He really could have done. To begin with, it was fun. He had a ball, living dangerously, taking risks, cleaning up on high-yield long-term investments, and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody. In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about two-fifty-five, when you know you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark tea-time of the soul. So things began to pall for him. The merry smiles he used to wear at other people's funerals began to fade. He began to despise the universe in general, and everybody in it in particular. This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing that would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on for ever. It was this. He would insult the universe. That is, he would insult everybody in it, individually, personally, one by one, and—this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over—in alphabetical order. When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that the plan was not merely misguided, but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would merely fix them with a steely look and say, A man can dream, can't he? And so he had started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built to last, with a computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known universe, and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved. His ship flared through the inner orbits of the Sol star system, preparing to slingshot around the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space. Computer, he said. Here, yipped the computer. Where next? Computing that. Warbacker gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the night, the billions of tiny diamond whorls that dusted the infinite darkness with light. Every one, every single one, was on his itinerary. Most of them he would be going to millions of times over. He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky like a child's numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that from some vantage point in the universe it might be seen to spell out a very, very rude word. The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its calculations. Folfanger, it said, it beeped. Fourth world of the Folfanger system, it continued. It beeped again. Estimated journey time three weeks. It continued further. It beeped again. There to meet with a small slug, it beeped, of the genus Arr-Earth-Up-Hill-Ip-Dinu. I believe, it added after a slight pause during which it beeped, that you had decided to call it a brainless prat. Wirebagger grunted. He watched the majesty of creation outside his window for a moment or two. I think I'll take a nap, he said, and then added, what network areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours? The computer beeped. Cosmo-beard, think-pix and home-brain-box, it said, and beeped. Any movies I haven't seen thirty thousand times already? No. There's Angst in Space. You've only seen that thirty three thousand five hundred and seventeen times. Wake me for the second reel. The computer beeped. Sleep well, it said. The ship fled on through the night. Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain, and Arthur Dent sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life, thinking of the things he could have said to the alien and swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening. The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin, because he thought it would be useful to keep things in.
 XXIII "'All right!' shouted Ford at Arthur. "'So I'm a coward. The point is I'm still alive.' They were back aboard the starship Bistromath. So was Slarty Bartfast. So was Trillian. Harmony and Concord were not. "'Well, so I'm alive, aren't I?' retaliated Arthur, haggard with adventure and anger. His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if they wanted to punch each other. "'You damn nearly weren't!' exploded Ford. Arthur turned sharply to Slarty Bartfast, who was sitting in his pilot-couch on the flight-deck, gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a bottle that was telling him something he clearly couldn't fathom. He appealed to him. "'Do you think he understands the first word I've been saying?' he said, quivering with emotion. "'I don't know,' replied Slarty Bartfast a little abstractedly. "'I'm not sure,' he added, glancing up very briefly, "'that I do.' He stared at his instruments with renewed vigour and bafflement. "'You'll have to explain it to us again,' he said. "'Well—' "'But later, terrible things are afoot.' He tapped the pseudoglass of the bottle-bottom. "'We fared rather pathetically at the party, I'm afraid,' he said. "'And our only hope now is to try and prevent the robots from using the key in the lock. How in Heaven we'd do that, I don't know,' he muttered. "'Just have to go there, I suppose. Can't say I like the idea at all. Probably end up dead.' "'Where is Trillian, anyway?' said Arthur, with a sudden affectation of unconcern. What he had been angry about was that Ford had berated him for wasting time over all the business of the Thunder-God when they could have been making a rather more rapid escape. Arthur's own opinion—and he had offered it for whatever anybody might have felt it was worth—was that he had been extraordinarily brave and resourceful. The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a pair of fettered dingoes' kidneys. What really hurt, though, was that Trillian didn't seem to react much one way or the other, and had wandered off somewhere. "'And where are my potato crisps?' said Ford. "'They are both,' said Slarty-Bart fast, without looking up, "'in the room of informational delusions. I think that your young lady friend is trying to understand some problems of galactic history. I think the potato crisps are probably helping her.'"
 Chapter XXXII A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the trees, upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust. The noise danced and skittered around the clearing. It whooped, it rasped, it generally offended. The Captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulgent eye. Little could disturb his equanimity. Indeed, once he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago, he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him. Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they hadn't yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would come, and in the meantime search parties were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably one in a nice leafy glade, and whether it was near a soap-mine, perfection. To those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn't found in mines, the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps this was because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged. No, life was very pleasant, and the great thing about it was that when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap-mine had been located and was producing five hundred kinks a day, it would be more pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look forward to. "'Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak!' went the bag-pipes, increasing the Captain's already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop. That was something he looked forward to as well. "'What else was pleasant?' he asked himself. "'Well, so many things. The red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching, the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath, where a couple of hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art-director and his assistant, the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath. The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all the time, or indeed at all, was six phones that didn't ring all the time, or indeed at all. Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting.' The Captain punched his rubber-duck playfully on the beak. The afternoon committee meetings were his favourite. Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from foreign climbs. After his six-month journey he was lean and healthy, his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer-skin coat, his beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a country rock singer's. He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgothrins for almost a week now, and Ford had decided it was time to stir things up a bit. The clearing was now full. Hundreds of men and women lounged around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards, and generally having a fairly relaxed time of it. Their tracksuits were now all dirty and even torn, but they all had immaculately styled hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their tracksuits full of leaves, and wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the coming winter. Ford's eyes narrowed. They couldn't be interested in botany all of a sudden, could they? In the middle of these speculations the Captain's voice rose above the hubbub. "'All right,' he said. "'I'd like to call this meeting to some sort of order, if that's at all possible. Is that all right with everybody?' He smiled genuinely. 'In a minute, when you're all ready.' The talking gradually died away, and the clearing fell silent, except for the bagpiper, who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own. A few of those in his immediate vicinity threw some leaves at him. If there was any reason for this, then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment. A small group of people had clustered round the Captain, and one of them was clearly preparing to speak. He did this by standing up, clearing his throat, and then gazing off into the distance, as if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a minute. The crowd, of course, were riveted, and all turned their eyes on him. A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak. Ford dropped down out of the tree. 'Hi there,' he said. The crowd swivelled round. 'Ah, my dear fellow,' called out the Captain. 'Got any matches on you, or a lighter, anything like that?' 'No,' said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what he'd prepared. He'd decided he'd be a little stronger on the subject. 'No, I haven't,' he continued. 'No matches. Instead, I bring you news.' 'Oh, pity,' said the Captain. 'We've all run out, you see. Haven't had a hot bath in weeks.' Ford refused to be headed off. 'I bring you news,' he said, '...of a discovery that might interest you.' 'Is it on the agenda?' snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted. Ford smiled a broad, country-rock singer smile. 'Now, come on,' he said. 'Well, I'm sorry,' said the man, huffily, '...but speaking as a Management Consultant of many years' standing, I must insist on the importance of observing the Committee structure.' Ford looked round the crowd. 'He's mad, you know. This is a prehistoric planet.' 'Address the Chair,' snapped the Management Consultant. 'There isn't a chair,' explained Ford. 'There's only a rock.' The Management Consultant decided that testiness was what the situation now called for. 'Well, call it a chair,' he said, testily. 'Why not call it a rock?' asked Ford. 'You obviously have no conception,' said the Management Consultant, now abandoning testiness in favour of good old-fashioned hauteur, '...of modern business methods.' 'And you have no conception of where you are,' said Ford. A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it. 'Shut up, you two. I want a table of motion.' 'You mean boulder emotion,' tittered the Hairdresser. 'Order, order,' yapped the Management Consultant. 'All right,' said Ford. 'Let's see how you're doing.' He plonked himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his temper. The Captain made a sort of conciliatory, harrumphing noise. 'I would like to call to order,' he said pleasantly, '...the 573rd meeting of the Colonisation Committee of Fintlewoodlewicks.' Ten seconds thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again. 'This is futile!' he exclaimed. '573 committee meetings, and you haven't even discovered fire yet!' 'If you would care,' said the girl with a strident voice, '...to examine the agenda sheet.' 'Agenda rock,' trilled the Hairdresser happily. 'Thank you. I've made that point,' muttered Ford. 'You will see,' continued the girl firmly, '...that we are having a report from the Hairdresser's Fire Development Sub-committee today.' 'Oh! Ah!' said the Hairdresser, with a sheepish look which has recognised the whole galaxy over as meaning, '...will next Tuesday do.' 'All right,' said Ford, rounding on him. 'What have you done? What are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?' 'Well, I don't know,' said the Hairdresser. 'All they gave me was a couple of sticks.' 'So what have you done with them?' Nervously the Hairdresser fished in his tracksuit top and handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford. Ford held them up for all to see. 'Curling tongs,' he said. The crowd applauded. 'Never mind,' said Ford. 'Rome wasn't burnt in a day.' The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but they loved it nevertheless. They applauded. 'Well, you're obviously being totally naive, of course,' said the girl. 'When you've been in marketing as long as I have, you'll know that before any new product can be developed, it has to be properly researched. You've got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them.' The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful from Ford. 'Stick it up your nose,' he said. 'Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,' insisted the girl. 'Do people want fire that can be fitted nasally?' 'Do you?' Ford asked the crowd. 'Yes!' shouted some. 'No!' shouted others happily. They didn't know. They just thought it was great. 'And the wheel?' said the captain. 'What about this wheel thingy? It sounds a terribly interesting project.' 'Ah!' said the marketing girl. 'Well, we're having a little difficulty there.' 'Difficulty!' exclaimed Ford. 'Difficulty! What do you mean, difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in the entire universe!' The marketing girl soured him with a look. 'All right, Mr Wise Guy,' she said. 'You're so clever, you tell us what colour it should be.' The crowd went wild. It was like a home team, they thought. Ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again. 'Almighty Zarkwan,' he said, 'had none of you done anything?' As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from the entrance to the clearing. The crowd couldn't believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon. In march a squad of about a dozen men, dressed in the remnants of their Golga-French and Third Regiment dress uniforms. About half of them still carried kilo-zap guns. The rest now carried spears, which they struck together as they marched. They looked bronzed, healthy, and utterly exhausted and bedraggled. They clattered to a halt and banged to attention. One of them fell over and never moved again. 'Captain, sir!' cried No. 2, for he was their leader. 'Permission to report, sir!' 'Yes, all right, No. 2. Welcome back and all that. Find any hot springs?' said the captain despondently. 'No, sir!' Thought you wouldn't. No. 2 strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath. 'We have discovered another continent!' 'Oh, when was this?' 'It lies across the sea,' said No. 2, narrowing his eyes significantly. 'To the east!' Ah. No. 2 turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd. 'We have declared war on it!' Wild, abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing. This was beyond all expectation. 'Wait a minute!' shouted Ford Prefect. 'Wait a minute!' He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got it, or at least the best silence he could hope for, under the circumstances. The circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem. 'Do we have to have the piper?' demanded Ford. 'Oh, yes,' said the captain. 'We've given him a grant.' Ford considered opening this idea up for debate, but quickly decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well-judged rock at the piper and turned to face No. 2. 'War?' he said. 'Yes!' No. 2 gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect. 'On the next continent?' 'Yes. Total warfare. The war to end all wars.' But there's no one even living there yet. Ah, interesting, thought the crowd. Nice point. No. 2's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect his eyes were like a couple of mosquitoes that hover purposefully three inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats or rolled newspapers. 'I know that,' he said. 'But there will be one day. So we have left an open-ended ultimatum.' What? 'And blown up a few military installations.' The captain leaned forward out of his bath. 'Military installations, No. 2?' he said. For a moment the eyes wavered. 'Yes, sir. Well, potential military installations. All right. Trees.' The moment of uncertainty passed. His eyes flicked like whips over his audience. 'And,' he roared, 'we interrogated a gazelle!' He flipped his killer zap smartly under his arm and marched off through the pandemonium that had now erupted through the ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all he managed before he was caught up and carried shoulder-high for a lap of honour around the clearing. Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together. 'So what else have you done?' he inquired after the celebrations had died down. 'We have started a culture,' said the marketing girl. 'Oh, yes,' said Ford. 'Yes. One of our film producers is already making a fascinating documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area.' 'They're not cavemen.' 'They look like cavemen.' 'Do they live in caves?' 'Well, they live in huts.' 'Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated,' called out a wag from the crowd. Ford rounded on him, angry. 'Very funny,' he said. 'But have you noticed that they're dying out?' On their journey back, Ford and Arthur had come across two derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods, where they had crept away to die. Those that still lived seemed stricken and listless, as if they were suffering from some disease of the spirit rather than the body. They moved sluggishly and with an infinite sadness. Their future had been taken away from them. 'Dying out,' repeated Ford. 'Do you know what that means?' 'Uh, we shouldn't sell them any life insurance?' called out the wag again. Ford ignored him and appealed to the whole crowd. 'Can you try and understand,' he said, 'that it's just since we've arrived here that they've started dying out?' 'In fact, that comes over very well in this film,' said the marketing girl, 'and it gives it that poignant twist which is the hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer's very committed.' He should be,' muttered Ford. 'I gather,' said the girl, turning to address the captain, who was beginning to nod off, 'that he wants to make one about you next, captain.' 'Oh, oh, really?' he said, coming to with a start. 'That's awfully nice. He's got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of responsibility, the loneliness of command.' The captain hummed and hawed about this for a moment. 'Well, I wouldn't over-stress that angle, you know,' he said finally. Ford was never alone with the rubber duck. He held the duck aloft, and he got an appreciative round from the crowd. All this while the management consultant had been sitting in stony silence, his fingertips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was waiting, and would wait all day if necessary. At this point he decided that he would not wait all day after all. He would merely pretend that the last half-hour hadn't happened. He rose to his feet. 'If,' he said tersely, 'we could for a moment move on to the subject of fiscal policy.' "'Fiscal policy!' whooped Ford Prefect. "'Fiscal policy!' The management consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish could have copied. "'Fiscal policy,' he repeated. "'That is what I said.' "'How can you have money?' demanded Ford. "'If none of you actually produces anything. "'It doesn't grow on trees, you know.' "'If you will allow me to continue.' Ford nodded dejectedly. "'Thank you. "'Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, "'we have, of course, all become immensely rich.' Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at this, and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with which their tracksuits were stuffed. "'But we have also,' continued the management consultant, "'run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, "'which means that, I gather, the current going rate "'has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's peanut.' "'Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. "'The management consultant waved them down. "'So in order to obviate this problem,' he continued, "'and effectively revalue the leaf, "'we are about to embark on a massive defoliation programme "'and, er, burn down all the forests. "'I think you'll agree that's a sensible move under the circumstances.' "'The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two, "'until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in their pockets, "'whereupon they let out whoops of delight "'and gave the management consultant a standing ovation. "'The accountants amongst them looked forward to a profitable autumn. "'You're all mad,' explained Ford Prefect. "'You're absolutely balmy,' he suggested. "'You're a bunch of raving nutters,' he opined. "'The tide of opinion was beginning to turn against him. "'What had started out as an excellent entertainment "'had now, in the crowd's view, deteriorated into mere abuse, "'and since this abuse was in the main directed at them, they wearied of it. "'Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him. "'Is it perhaps in order,' she demanded, "'to enquire what you have been doing all these months, then? "'You and that other interloper have been missing since the day we arrived.' "'We've been on a journey,' said Ford. "'We went to try and find out something about this planet.' "'Oh,' said the girl, archly, "'doesn't sound very productive to me.' "'No? Well, have I got news for you, my love. "'We have discovered this planet's future.' "'Ford waited for the statement to have its effect. "'It didn't have any. They didn't know what he was talking about.' "'He continued. "'It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingoes' kidneys "'what you all choose to do from now on. "'Burn down the forests, anything. "'It won't make a scrap of difference. "'Your future history has already happened. "'Two million years you've got, and that's it. "'At the end of that time your race will be dead, gone, "'and good riddance to you. Remember that. Two million years!' "'The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. "'People as rich as they had suddenly become "'shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish. "'Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away.' "'They didn't need to bother. "'Ford was already stalking out of the clearing, "'pausing only to shake his head at No. 2, "'who was already firing his killer's app into some neighbouring trees. "'He turned back once. "'Two million years!' he said, and laughed. "'Well,' said the Captain, with a soothing smile, "'still time for a few more baths. "'Could someone pass me the sponge? I've just dropped it over the side.'
 Chapter 15 Eight hours west sat a man alone on a beach, mourning an inexplicable loss. He could only think of his loss in little packets of grief at a time, because the whole thing was too great to be borne. He watched the long, slow Pacific waves come in along the sand, and waited, and waited, for the nothing that he knew was about to happen. As the time came for it not to happen, it duly didn't happen, and so the afternoon wore itself away, and the sun dropped beneath the long line of the sea, and the day was gone. The beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private house was there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from Los Angeles, which is described in the new edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in one entrious, junky, wonky, stunky, and what's that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff, woo, and in another, written only hours later, as being like several thousand square miles of American Express junk mail, but without the same sense of moral depth. Plus the air is, for some reason, yellow. The coastline runs west, and then turns north up to the misty bay of San Francisco, which the Guide describes as a good place to go. It's very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is also a space traveler. Starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying hi. Until you've settled in and got the hang of the place, it is best to say no to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you, because there are some very strange things going on there, some of which an unsuspecting alien could die of. The hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and sand, palm trees, breakers, and sunsets are described in the Guide as buffo, a good one. And somewhere on this good buffo stretch of coastline lay the house of this inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being insane, but this was only, as he would tell people, because he was. One of the many, many reasons why people thought him insane was because of the peculiarity of his house, which, even in a land where most people's houses were peculiar in one way or another, was quite extreme in its peculiarness. His house was called the Outside of the Asylum. His name was simply John Watson, though he preferred to be called, and some of his friends have now reluctantly agreed to do this, Wonko the Sane. In his house were a number of strange things, including a grey glass bowl with eight words engraved upon it. We can talk of him much later on. This is just an interlude to watch the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it. He had lost everything he cared for and was now simply waiting for the end of the world, little realising that it had already been and gone.
 XXIX. Tell us, said the thin, pale-faced cricketer, who had stepped forward from the ranks of the others, and stood uncertainly in the circle of light, handling his gun as if he was just holding it for someone else, who had just popped off somewhere, but will be back in a minute. Do you know anything about something called the balance of nature?" There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing more articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts. The flashlight continued to play over them. High in the sky above them, dark activity continued in the robot zones. "'It's just,' continued the cricketer uneasily, "'something we heard about. Um—' "'Probably nothing important. Well, I suppose we'd better kill you then.' He looked down at his gun as if he were trying to find which bit to press. "'Um—that is,' he said, looking up again, "'unless there's anything you want to chat about?' Slow numb astonishment crept up the bodies of Slartibartfast, Ford, and Arthur. Very soon it would reach their brains, which were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jaw-bones up and down. Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a jigsaw puzzle by shaking the box. "'We're worried, you see,' said another man from the crowd, "'about this plan of universal destruction.' "'Yes,' added another, "'and the balance of nature. It just seemed to us that if the whole of the rest of the universe is destroyed it'll somehow upset the balance. We're quite keen on ecology, you see.' His voice trailed away unhappily. "'And sport,' said another loudly. This got a cheer of approval from the others. "'Yes,' agreed the first. "'And sport.' He looked back at his fellows uneasily, and scratched fitfully at his cheek. He seemed to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion, as if everything he wanted to say and everything he thought were entirely different things between which he could see no possible connection. "'You see,' he mumbled, "'some of us—' and he looked around again as if for confirmation. The others made encouraging noises. "'Some of us,' he continued, "'are quite keen to have sporting links with the rest of the galaxy, and though I can see the argument about keeping sport out of politics, I think that if we want to have sporting links with the rest of the galaxy—which we do—then it's probably a mistake to destroy it, and indeed the rest of the universe.' His voice trailed away again. "'Which is what seems to be the idea now.' "'What?' said Slarty Bartfast. "'What?' said Arthur. "'Dri—' said Ford Prefect. "'Okay,' said Trillian, "'let's talk about it.' She walked forward and took the poor, confused cricketer by the arm. He looked about twenty-five, which meant, because of the peculiar manglings of time that had been going on in this area, that he would have been just twenty when the cricket wars were finished ten billion years ago. Trillian led him for a short walk through the light before she said anything more. He stumbled uncertainly after her. The encircling flashlight beams were drooping slightly now as if they were abdicating to the strange, quiet girl who alone in this universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing. She turned and faced him and lightly held both his arms. He was a picture of bewildered misery. "'Tell me,' she said. He said nothing for a moment, while his gaze darted from one of her eyes to the other. "'We—' he said. "'We have to be alone, I think.' He screwed up his face and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like someone trying to shake a coin out of a money-box. He looked up again. "'We have this bomb now, you see,' he said. "'It's just a little one.' "'I know,' she said.' He goggled at her as if she had said something very strange about beetroots. "'Honestly,' he said, ''it's very, very little.' "'I know,' she said again. "'But they say,' his voice trailed on, "'they say it can destroy everything that exists. And we have to do that, you see, I think. Will that make us alone? I don't know. It seems to be our function, though,' he said, and dropped his head again. "'Whatever that means,' said a hollow voice from the crowd. Trillian slowly put her arms round the poor, bewildered young cricketer, and patted his trembling head on her shoulder. "'It's all right,' she said, quietly, but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd to hear. "'You don't have to do it.' She rocked him. "'You don't have to do it,' she said again. She let him go and stood back. "'I want you to do something for me,' she said, and unexpectedly laughed. "'I want—' she said, and laughed again. She put her hand over her mouth, and then said with a straight face, "'I want you to take me to your leader.' And she pointed into the war-zones in the sky. She seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there. Their laughter seemed to discharge something in the atmosphere. From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to sing a tune that would have enabled Paul McCartney, had he written it, to buy the world.
 Chapter 10 The universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place—a fact which, for the sake of a quiet life, most people tend to ignore. Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own devising, and this is what most beings, in fact, do. For instance, in one corner of the eastern galactic arm lies the large forest planet Oglurun, the entire intelligent population of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut-tree, in which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the futility of death, and the importance of birth control, fight a few extremely minor wars, and eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less accessible outer branches. In fact, the only Oglurunians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the other trees might be capable of supporting life at all, or, indeed, whether the other trees are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many oglurnuts. Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life-form in the galaxy which is in some way not guilty of the same thing, which is why the total perspective vortex is as horrific as it is. For when you are put into the vortex, you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says, You are here. The grey plane stretched before Zephod, a ruined, shattered plane, the wind whipped wildly over it. Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This, gathered Zephod, was where he was going. This was the total perspective vortex. As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of terror emanated from it, as of a man having his soul burnt from his body. It screamed above the wind and died away. Zephod started with fear, and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium. Hey, what was that? he muttered voicelessly. A recording, said Gargravan, of the last man who was put in the vortex. It is always played to the next victim, a sort of prelude. Hey, it really sounds bad, stammered Zephod. Couldn't we maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, thinking over? For all I know, said Gargravan's ethereal voice, I am probably at one. My body, that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me. Says I only get in the way. Hey-ho. What is all this about your body? said Zephod, anxious to delay whatever it was that was going to happen to him. Well, it's busy, you know, said Gargravan, hesitantly. You mean it's got a mind of its own, said Zephod. There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravan spoke again. I have to say, he replied eventually, that I find that remark in rather poor taste. Zephod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology. No matter, said Gargravan. You weren't to know. The voice fluttered unhappily. The truth is, it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very hard to keep it under control, the truth is that we are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation. I suspect it will end in divorce. The voice was still again, leaving Zephod with no idea of what to say. He mumbled uncertainly. I think we were probably not very well suited, said Gargravan again at length. We never seemed to be happy doing the same things. We always had the greatest arguments, over sex and fishing. Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine. And now my body refuses to let me in. It won't even see me. He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain. It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was meant to inhabit it, and it said that was exactly the sort of smart aleck remark that got right up a body's left nostril. And so we left it. It will probably get custody of my forename. Oh, said Zephod faintly. And what's that? Pizpod, said the voice. My name is Pizpod Gargravan. Says it all, really, doesn't it? Err, said Zephod sympathetically. And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job. Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk on the ground of this planet, except the victims of the vortex. They don't really count, I'm afraid. Uh. I'll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it? Uh. Many years ago, this was a thriving, happy planet. People, cities, shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of these cities, there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought necessary. And slowly and insidiously, the numbers of these shoe shops were increasing. It's a well-known economic phenomenon, but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe shops there were, the more shoes they had to make, and the worse and more unwearable they became. And the worse they were to wear, the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the more the shops proliferated, until the whole economy of the place passed what I believe is termed the shoe event horizon, and it became no longer economically possible to build anything other than shoe shops. Result? Collapse, ruin, and famine. Most of the population died out. Those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds. You've seen one of them. Who cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should walk on it again. Unhappy lot, come, I must take you to the vortex." Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the plain. And you, he said, you come from this hellhole pit, do you? No, no, said Gargravar, taken aback. I come from the frog-style world sea. Beautiful place, wonderful fishing. I've flit back there in the evenings, though all I can do now is watch. The total perspective vortex is the only thing on this planet with any function. It was built here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep. At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod shuddered. What can do that to a guy? he breathed. The universe, said Gargravar simply, the whole infinite universe, the infinite suns, the infinite distances between them, and yourself, an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small. Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebroxman, you know, muttered Zaphod, trying to flap the last remnants of his ego. Gargravar made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain. As they reached it a door hummed open in the side, revealing a small darkened chamber within. Enter, said Gargravar. Zaphod started with fear. Hey, what, now? he said. Now, Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small, it was steel-lined and there was hardly space in it for more than one man. It, uh, it doesn't look like any kind of a vortex to me, said Zaphod. It isn't, said Gargravar. It's just the elevator. Enter. With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of Gargravar being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied man was not for the moment speaking. The elevator began its descent. I must, uh, get myself into the right frame of mind for this, muttered Zaphod. There is no right frame of mind, said Gargravar sternly. You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate. I don't. The vortex does. At the bottom of the shaft the rear of the elevator opened up and Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined chamber. At the far end of it stood a single upright steel box, just large enough for a man to stand in. It was that simple. It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a single thick wire. Is that it? said Zaphod in surprise. That is it. It didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod. And I get in there, do I? said Zaphod. You get in there, said Gargravar, and I'm afraid you must do it now. Okay, okay, said Zaphod. He opened the door of the box and stepped in. Inside the box he waited. After five seconds there was a click and the entire universe was there in the box with him.
 CHAPTER XII SHUSH, said Slartibartfast. Listen and watch. Night had now fallen on ancient Cricket. The sky was dark and empty. The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which pleasant, convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze. They stood beneath a tree from which heady fragrances wafted around them. Arthur squatted and felt the informational illusion of the soil and the grass. He ran it through his fingers. The soil seemed rich and heavy, the grass strong. It was hard to avoid the impression that this is a thoroughly delightful place in all respects. The sky was, however, extremely blank, and seemed to Arthur to cast a certain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, landscape. Still, he supposed, it's a question of what you're used to. He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up. Slartibartfast was quietly directing his attention to something down the other side of the hill. He looked, and could just see some faint lights dancing and waving, and moving slowly in their direction. As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the dim lights and noises resolved themselves into a small group of people who were walking home across the hill towards the town. They walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree, swinging lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance amongst the trees and grass, chattering contentedly, and actually singing a song about how terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how much they enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to be going home to see their wives and children, with a lilting chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling particularly nice at this time of year, and that it was a pity the dog had died, seeing as it liked them so much. Arthur could almost imagine Paul McCartney sitting with his feet up by the fire one evening, humming it to Linda, and wondering what to buy with the proceeds, and thinking probably Essex. "'The Masters of Cricket,' breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral tones. Humming as he did so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about Essex, this remark caused Arthur a moment's confusion. Then the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind, and he discovered that he still didn't understand what the old man meant. "'What?' he said. "'The Masters of Cricket,' said Slartibartfast again, and if his breathing had been sepulchral before this time he sounded like someone in Hades with bronchitis.' Arthur peered at the group, and tried to make sense of what little information he had at his disposal at this point. The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they seemed a little tall, thin, angular, and almost as pale as to be white, but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant—a little whimsical, perhaps—one wouldn't necessarily want to spend a long coach-journey with them—but the point was that if they deviated in any way from being good, straightforward people, it was in being perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough. So why all this rasping lung-work from Slartibartfast, which would seem more appropriate to a radio commercial of one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them? Then this cricket angle was a tough one too. He hadn't quite fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket and what—' Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point, as if sensing what was going through his mind. "'The game you know as cricket,' he said, and his voice still seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, "'is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind eons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time. Of all the races in the galaxy, only the English could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the universe, and transform it into what I'm afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game.' "'Rather fond of it myself,' he added. "'But in most people's eyes you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesquely bad taste. Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket. That's very nasty.' "'Um!' said Arthur, with a reflective frown to indicate that his cognitive synapses were coping with this as best they could. "'Um! And these,' said Slartibart fast, slipping back into crypt guttural, and indicating the group of cricket-men who had now walked past them, "'are the ones who started it all. And it will start to-night. Come, we will follow and see why.' They slipped out from underneath the tree, and followed the cheery party along the dark hill path. Their natural instinct was to tread quietly and stillfully in pursuit of their quarry, though, as they were simply walking through a recorded informational illusion they could as easily have been wearing euphoniums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them. Arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now singing a different song. It came lilting back to them through the soft night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted McCartney, Kent, and Sussex, and enabled him to put an affair offer for Hampshire. "'You must surely know,' said Slartibart fast to Ford, "'what it is that is about to happen.' "'Me?' said Ford. "'No.' "'Did you not learn ancient galactic history when you were a child?' "'I was in the cyber-cubicle behind Zaphod,' said Ford. "'It was pretty distracting. Which isn't to say that I didn't learn some pretty stunning things.' At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that the party were singing. The Middle-Eight Bridge, which would have had McCartney firmly consolidated in Winchester, and gazing intently over the Test Valley to the rich pickings of the New Forest beyond, had some curious lyrics. The song-writer was referring to meeting with a girl not under the moon or beneath the stars, but above the grass, which struck Arthur as being a little prosaic. Then he looked up again at the bewilderingly blank sky, and had the distinct feeling that there was an important point here, if only he could grasp what it was. It gave him a feeling of being alone in the universe, and he said so. "'No,' said Slartibart fast, with a slight quickening of his step. "'The people of Cricket have never thought to themselves, We are alone in the universe. They are surrounded by a huge dust-cloud, you see, their single sun with its single world, and they are right out on the utmost eastern edge of the galaxy. Because of the dust-cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky. At night it is totally blank. During the day there is the sun, but you can't look directly at that, so they don't. They are hardly aware of the sky. It is as if they had a blind-spot which extended a hundred and eighty degrees from horizon to horizon. You see, the reason why they have never thought, We are alone in the universe, is that until to-night they don't know about the universe. Until to-night.' He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him. "'Imagine,' he said, never even thinking, We are alone, simply because it has never occurred to you to think that there's any other way to be.' He moved on again. "'I'm afraid this is going to be a little unnerving,' he added. As he spoke they became aware of a very thin, roaring scream high up in the sightless sky above them. They glanced upwards in alarm, but for a moment or two could see nothing. Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to do with it. They were glancing around themselves in consternation, left, right, forwards, backwards, even at the ground. It never occurred to them to look upwards. The profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few moments later, when the burning wreckage of a space-ship came hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half a mile from where they were standing, was something that you had to be there to experience. Some speak of the Heart of Gold in hushed tones. Some speak of the starship Bistromath. Many speak of the legendary and gigantic starship Titanic, a majestic and luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great ship-building asteroid complexes of Artefactorval some hundreds of years ago now, and with good reason. It was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history—see note below on the campaign for real time. But it had the misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of improbability physics, long before this difficult and cussed branch of knowledge was fully, or at all, understood. The designers and engineers decided in their innocence to build a prototype improbability field into it, which was meant, supposedly, to ensure that it was infinitely improbable that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship. They did not realize that because of the quasi-reciprocal and circular nature of all improbability calculations, anything that was infinitely improbable was actually very likely to happen almost immediately. The starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay beached like a silver Arcturian megavoid whale, amongst the laser-lit tracery of its construction gantries, a brilliant cloud of pins and needles of light against a deep interstellar blackness. But when launched, it did not even manage to complete its very first radio message, an SOS, before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total existence failure. However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another. It was conclusively proved that more people watched a tri-D TV coverage of the launch than actually existed at the time, and this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever in the science of audience research. Another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova which the star Isolidins underwent a few hours later. Isolidins is the star around which most of the galaxy's major insurance underwriters live, or rather, lived. But whilst these spaceships and other great ones which come to mind, such as the Galactic Fleet battleships, the GSS Daring, the GSS Audacity, and the GSS Suicidal Insanity, are all spoken of with awe, pride, enthusiasm, affection, admiration, regret, jealousy, resentment, in fact, most of the better-known emotions, the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was Cricket 1, the first space ship ever built by the people of Cricket. This is not because it was a wonderful ship. It wasn't. It was a crazy piece of near junk. It looked as if it had been knocked up in someone's backyard, and this was, in fact, precisely where it had been knocked up. The astonishing thing about the ship was not that it was done well—it wasn't—but that it was done at all. The period of time which had elapsed between the moment that the people of Cricket had discovered that there was such a thing as space, and the launching of their first space ship, was almost exactly a year. Ford Prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped himself in, that this was just another informational illusion, and that he was therefore completely safe. In real life it wasn't a ship he would have set foot in for all the rice, wine, and china. Extremely rickety was one phrase which sprang to mind. Please may I get out was another. "'This is going to fly!' said Arthur, giving gaunt looks at the lashed-together pipe-work and wiring which festooned the cramped interior of the ship. Slarty Bartfuss assured him that it would, that they were perfectly safe, and that it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a little harrowing. Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed. "'Why not?' said Ford, go mad. In front of them, and of course totally unaware of their presence, for the very good reason that they weren't actually there, were the three pilots. They also had constructed the ship. They had been on the hill-path that night, singing wholesome, heart-warming songs. Their brains had been very slightly turned by the nearby crash of the alien space-ship. They had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that burnt-up ship, all the while singing lilting space-ship-stripping ditties. They had then built their own ship. And this was it—this was their ship, and they were currently singing a little song about that too, expressing the twin joys of achievement and ownership. The chorus was a little poignant and told of their sorrow that their work had kept them such long hours in the garage, away from the company of their wives and children, who had missed them terribly, but had kept them cheerful by bringing them continual stories of how nicely the puppy was growing up. Pow! they took off. They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it was doing. "'No way,' said Ford a while later, after they had recovered from the shock of acceleration and were climbing up out of the planet's atmosphere. "'No way,' he repeated, "'does anyone design and build a ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated.' "'I don't believe it. Prove it to me and I still won't believe it.' He shook his head thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at the nothingness outside it. The trip passed uneventfully for a while, and Slartibartfast fast wound them through it. Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner perimeter of the hollow spherical dust-cloud which surrounded their sun and home planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out. It was more as if there was a gradual change in the texture and consistency of space. The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them. It was a very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy darkness. It was the darkness of the night sky of Cricket. The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on Arthur's heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the Cricket pilots, which hung in the air like a thick static charge. They were now on the very boundary of the historical consciousness of their race. This was the very limit beyond which none of them had ever speculated, or even known that there was any speculation to be done. The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship. Inside was the silence of history. Their historic mission was to find out if there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky from which the wrecked space-ship could have come, and otherworld may be, strange and incomprehensible, though this thought was to the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Cricket. History was gathering itself to deliver another blow. Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank and closing darkness. It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier. And suddenly it was gone. They flew out of the cloud. They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust, and their minds sang with fear. For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the universe. And then they turned round. It'll have to go, the men of Cricket said, as they headed back for home. On the way back they sung a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family, life, and the obliteration of all other life-forms.
 XXVIII. Meanwhile, more millions of miles away than the mind can comfortably encompass, Zephod Beeblebrox was feeling bored. He had repaired his ship—that is, he had watched with alert interest while a service-robot had repaired it for him. It was now once again one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in existence. He could go anywhere, do anything. He fiddled with the book, and then tossed it away. It was the one he had read before. He walked over to the communications bank and opened an all-frequencies emergency channel. "'Anyone want a drink?' he asked. "'This an emergency, fella?' crackled a voice from halfway across the galaxy. "'Got any mixers?' said Zephod. "'No. Go take a ride on a comet.' "'Okay, okay,' said Zephod, and flipped the channel shut again. He sighed and sat down. He got up again and wandered over to a computer screen. He pushed a few buttons. Little blobs started to rush around the screen, eating each other. "'Pow!' said Zephod. "'Free-oo! Pop! Pop! Pop!' "'Hi there,' said the computer briefly after a minute of this. "'You have scored three points. Previous best score 7,797,200—' "'Okay, okay,' said Zephod, and flipped the screen blank again. He sat down again. He played with a pencil. This, too, began slowly to lose its fascination. "'Okay, okay,' he said, and fed his score and the previous best one into the computer. His ship made a blur of the universe.
 Chapter XVIII. The main reception foyer was almost empty, but Ford nevertheless weaved his way through it. Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm, and maneuvered him into a cubicle, standing to one side of the entrance-hall. "'What are you doing to him?' asked Arthur. "'Oh, sobering him up,' said Zaphod, and pushed a coin into a slot. Lights flashed, gases swirled. "'Hi,' said Ford, stepping out a moment later. "'Where are we going?' "'Down to the car-park. Come on.' "'What about the personnel-time-teleport?' said Ford. "'Get us straight back to the Heart of Gold.' "'Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zoddywook can have it. I don't want to play his games. Let's see what we can find.' A serious cybernetics corporation, happy vertical people-transporter, took them down deep into the substratum beneath the restaurant. They were glad to see it had been vandalized, and didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down. At the bottom of the shaft the lift-doors opened, and a blast of cold, stale air hit them. The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over fifty doors in it, offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty major life-forms. Nevertheless, like every car-park in the galaxy throughout the entire history of car-parks, this car-park smelt predominantly of impatience. They turned a corner, and found themselves on a moving catwalk that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim distance. It was divided off into bays, each of which contained a spaceship belonging to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and utilitarian mass-production models, others vast shining limo-ships, the playthings of the very rich. Sayford's eyes sparkled at something that may or may not have been avarice as he passed over them. In fact, it's best to be clear on this point. Avarice is definitely what it was. "'There he is,' said Trillian. "'Marvin, down there!' They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a small metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner of a giant silver sun-cruiser. At short intervals along the moving catwalk wide transparent tubes led down to the floor Sayford stepped off the catwalk into one of these and floated gently downwards. The others followed. Thinking back to this later, Arthur thought it was the single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the galaxy. "'Hey, Marvin!' said Sayford, striding over towards him. "'Hey, kid, are we pleased to see you?' Marvin turned, and in so far as it is possible for a totally inert metal face to look reproachful, this is what it did. "'No, you're not,' he said. "'No one ever is.' "'Now suit yourself,' said Sayford, and turned away to ogle the ships. Ford went with him. Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin. "'Now really we are,' said Trillian, and patted him in a way that he disliked intensely, hanging around waiting for us all this time. "'Five hundred and seventy-six thousand million three thousand five hundred and seventy-nine years,' said Marvin. "'I counted them.' "'Well, we're here now,' said Trillian, feeling quite correctly in Marvin's view that it was a slightly foolish thing to say. "'The first ten million years were the worst,' said Marvin, "'and the second ten million they were the worst too. The third ten million I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline.' "'Pause just long enough to make them feel they ought to say something,' and then interrupted. "'It's the people you meet in this job that really get you down,' he said, and paused again. "'Trillian cleared her throat. "'Is that----' "'The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago,' continued Marvin. Again the pause. "'Oh dear----' "'And that was with a coffee machine.' He waited. "'Well, that's a----' "'You don't like talking to me, do you?' said Marvin, in a low, desolate tone. Trillian talked to Arthur instead. Further down the chamber Ford Prefect had found something of which he very much liked to look, several such things, in fact. "'Seyford,' he said in a quiet voice, "'just look at some of these little star-trolleys!' Seyford looked and liked. The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small, but extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It was not much to look at. It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart, about twenty feet long, made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear end was a small horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny charm-drive engine, which was not capable of moving it at any great speed. The thing it did have, however, was a heat-sink. The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons, and was contained within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic field situated half-way along the length of the ship, and this heat-sink enabled the craft to be maneuvered within a few miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares that burst out from its surface. Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence, and those who can dare and afford to do it are amongst the most lionized men in the galaxy. It is also, of course, stupefyingly dangerous, and those who don't die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the Deedler's Club's apres-flare parties. Ford and Seyford looked and passed on. "'And this baby,' said Ford, "'the Tangerine Star-Buggy with the black sun-busters!' Then the Star-Buggy was a small ship, a totally misnamed one, in fact, because the one thing it couldn't manage was interstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty planet-hopper, doled up to look like something it wasn't. Nice lines, though. They passed on. The next one was a big one, and thirty yards long, a coach-built limo-ship, and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of making the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork and accessory detail clearly said, not only am I rich enough to afford this ship, I am also rich enough not to take it seriously. It was wonderfully hideous.' "'Just look at it,' said Seyford. "'Multicluster quark-drive, perspulex running-boards. Gotta be a Laszlo Lyricon custom job.' He examined every inch. "'Yes,' he said. "'Look! The Infrapink Lizard-Album on the Neutrino-Calling, Laszlo's trademark. The man has no shame!' I was passed by one of these mothers once up by the Axel Nebula,' said Ford. "'I was going flat out, and this thing just strolled past me, star-drive hardly taking over. Just incredible!' Seyford whistled appreciatively. "'Ten seconds later,' said Ford, 'it smashed straight into the third moon of Jaglan Beta.' "'Yeah, right? Amazing-looking ship, though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow.' Ford looked round the other side. "'Hey, come see,' he called out. "'There's a big mural painted on the side, a bursting sun. Disaster-area is trademarked. This must be Hot Black's ship, lucky old bugger. They do this terrible song, you know, which ends with a stunt-ship crashing into the sun. Meant to be an amazing spectacle. Expensive in stunt-ships, though.' Seyford's attention, however, was elsewhere. His attention was riveted on the ship standing next to Hot Black Desiato's limo. His mouth hung open. "'That,' he said, "'that is really bad for the eyes.'' Ford looked. He too stood astonished. It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon. Twenty yards long, very clean, very sleek. There was just one remarkable thing about it. "'It's so black,' said Ford Prefect. "'You can hardly make out its shape. Light just seems to fall into it.' Seyford said nothing. He had simply fallen in love. "'The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible to tell how close you were standing to it. "'Your eyes just slide off it,' said Ford in wonder. It was an emotional moment, he bit his lip. Seyford moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed, or more accurately, like a man who wanted to possess. His hand reached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached out to stroke it again. His hand stopped again. "'Hey, come and feel the surface,' he said in a hushed voice. Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped. "'You—you can't,' he said. "'See,' said Seyford, "'it's just totally frictionless. This must be one mother of a mover.' He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least one of his heads did. The other stayed gazing in awe at the ship. "'What do you reckon, Ford?' he said. "'You mean—' Ford looked over his shoulder. "'You mean—stroll off with it? You think we should?' "'No. Nor do I. "'But we're going to, aren't we? How can we not?' They gazed a little longer, till Seyford suddenly pulled himself together. "'We'd better shift soon,' he said. "'In a moment or so the Universe will have ended, and all the Captain-creeps will come pouring down here to find their bourgeois-mobiles.' "'Seyford,' said Ford. "'Yeah?' "'How do we do it?' "'Ah, simple,' said Seyford. He turned. "'Marvin!' he called. Slowly, laboriously, and with the million little clanking and creaking noises that he'd learned to simulate, Marvin turned round to answer the summons. "'Come on over here,' said Seyford. "'We've got a job for you.' Marvin trudged towards them. "'I won't enjoy it,' he said. "'Yes you will,' enthused Seyford. "'There's a whole new life stretching out ahead of you.' "'Oh, not another one,' cried Marvin. "'Look, will you shut up and listen?' hissed Seyford. "'This time there's going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things.' "'Sounds awful.' "'Marvin, all I'm trying to ask you—' "'I suppose you want me to open the space-ship for you.' "'What? Ah, yeah, yeah, that's right,' said Seyford jumpily. He was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short. "'Well, I wish you'd just tell me, rather than trying to engage my enthusiasm,' said Marvin. "'Because I haven't got one.' He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung open. Ford and Seyford stared at the opening. "'Don't mention it,' said Marvin. "'Oh, you didn't.' He trudged away again. Arthur and Trillian clustered round. "'What's happening?' asked Arthur. "'Look at this,' said Ford. ''Look at the interior of this ship!' "'Weirder and weirder,' breathed Seyford. "'It's black,' said Ford. "'Everything in it is just totally black!' In the restaurant things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldn't be any more moments. All eyes were fixed on the dome other than those of Hot Black Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hot Black Desiato, and those of Hot Black Desiato himself, which the bodyguard had closed out of respect. The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hot Black Desiato been alive he would probably have deemed this a good moment to lean back or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was not a man who improved at proximity. On account of his unfortunate condition, however, Hot Black Desiato remained totally inert. "'Mr. Desiato, sir,' whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were clambering over each other to get out of the way. "'Mr. Desiato, can you hear me?' Hot Black Desiato quite naturally said nothing. "'Hot Black,' hissed the bodyguard. Again quite naturally Hot Black Desiato did not reply. Supernaturally, however, he did. On the table in front of him a wine-glass rattled, and a fork rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on the table again. The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt. "'It's time we were going, Mr. Desiato,' muttered the bodyguard. "'Don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a really big audience for it, one of the best. Cacrofoon. Five hundred and seventy-six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have been looking forward to it?' The fork rose again, paused, waggled in a noncommittal sort of way, and dropped again. "'Ah, come on,' said the bodyguard. "'It's going to have been great. You knocked them cold.' The bodyguard would have given Dr. Dan's treat-mentioner an apoplectic attack. The black ship going into the sun always gets them, and the new ones are beauty. We're real sorry to see it go. If we get on down there I'll set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off in the limo, OK?' The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine mysteriously emptied itself. The bodyguard wheeled Hot Black Desiato's chair out of the restaurant. "'And now,' cried Max from the centre of the stage, "'the moment you've all been waiting for!' He flung his arms into the air. He said to him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synth accords. Max had argued with them about this, but they claimed it was in their contract and that's what they would do. His agent would have to sort it out. "'The skies begin to boil!' he cried. "'Nature collapses into the screaming void, and twenty seconds' time the universe itself will be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!' The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them, and at that moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance. Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the band. None of them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet was joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done the show, and nothing like this had ever happened before. He drew back an alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so a figure slowly materialised inside, the figure of an ancient man, bearded, robed, and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars, and on his brow a golden crown. "'What's this?' whispered Max, wild-eyed. "'What's happening?' At the back of the restaurant the stony-faced party from the church of the second coming of the great prophet Zaghquan leapt ecstatically to their feet, chanting and crying. Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience. "'A big hand, please, ladies and gentlemen,' he hollered, "'for the great prophet Zaghquan! He has come! Zaghquan has come again!' Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and handed his microphone to the prophet. Zaghquan coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. The stars in his eyes twinkled uneasily. He handled the microphone with confusion. "'Uh,' he said, "'Hello? Look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the most ghastly time. All sorts of things cropping up at the last moment.' "'Um,' he seemed nervous with the expectant awed hush. He cleared his throat. "'Uh, how are we for time?' he said. "'Have I just got a minute?' He said, and so the universe ended.
 Chapter 13 Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge at the Heart of Gold. Trillian! Arthur! He shouted. It's working! The ship's reactivated! Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor. Come on, you guys, we're going. We're off, he said, kicking them awake. Hi there, guys! twitted the computer. It's really great to be back with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that— Shut up! said Ford. Just tell us where the hell we are. Frogstar World B, and man, it's a dump! said Zaphod, running onto the bridge. Hi, guys! You must be so amazingly glad to see me! You can't even find words to tell me what a cool fruit I am! What a what? said Arthur, blearily picking himself up from the floor and not taking any of the zin. I know how you feel, said Zaphod. I'm so great, even I get tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey, it's good to see you, Trillian. Ford, Monkeyman, hey, uh, Computer? Hi there, Mr. Beaverbrock, sir! It sure is a great honor to— Shut up and get us out of here! Fast, fast, fast! Sure thing, fella. Where do you want to go? Anywhere! Doesn't matter, shouted Zaphod. Yes, it does! he said again. We want to go to the nearest place to eat! Sure thing, said the Computer happily, and a massive explosion rocked the bridge. When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest.
 Chapter 19 One of the major selling points of that wholly remarkable travel book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its relative cheapness, and the fact that it has the words, Don't Panic, written in large, friendly letters on its cover, is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary. The statistics relating to the geosocial nature of the universe, for instance, are deftly set out between pages 938,324 and 938,326. And the simplistic style in which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors, having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it with a few footnotes, in order to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly tortuous galactic copyright laws. It is interesting to note that a later and wily editor sent the book backwards in time through a temporal warp, and then successfully sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement of the same laws. Here is a sample. The Universe. Some information to help you live in it. One. Area. Infinite. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of the word infinite. Infinite. Bigger than the biggest thing ever, and then some. Much bigger than that, in fact. Really amazingly immense. A totally stunning size. I mean, real, wow, that's big time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by, staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to get across here. Two. Imports. None. It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no outside to import things in from. Three. Exports. None. See, imports. Four. Population. None. It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds. So the average population of all the planets in the universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole universe is also zero, and any people you may meet from time to time are merely the product of a deranged imagination. Five. Monetary units. None. In fact, there are three freely convertible currencies in the galaxy, but none of them count. The Altarian dollar has recently collapsed, the Flanian pobble bead is only exchangeable for other Flanian pobble beads, and the Triganic pew has its own very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one pew is simple enough, but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin 6,800 miles along each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one pew. Ningis are not negotiable currency, because the galactic banks refuse to deal in fiddling a small change. From this basic premise, it is simple to prove that the galactic banks are also the product of a deranged imagination. Six. Art. None. The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there simply isn't a mirror big enough. See point one. Seven. Sex. None. Well, in fact, there is an awful lot of this, largely because of the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that might keep all the non-existent people of the universe occupied. However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now, because it really is terribly complicated. For further information, see Guide Chapter 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21 to 84 inclusive, and, in fact, most of the rest of the Guide.
 Chapter XXV. Those who are regular followers of the doings of Arthur Dent may have received an impression of his character and habits, which, while it includes the truth, and of course nothing but the truth, falls somewhat short in its composition of the whole truth in all its glorious aspects. And the reasons for this are obvious—editing, selection, and the need to balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant, and cut out all the tedious happenstance. Like this, for instance. Arthur Dent went to bed. He went up the stairs all fifteen of them, opened the door, went into his room, took off his shoes and socks, and then all the rest of his clothes one by one, and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor. He put on his pyjamas, the blue ones with the stripe. He washed his face and hands, cleaned his teeth, went to the lavatory, realized that he had once again got all this in the wrong order, had to wash his hands again, and went to bed. He read for fifteen minutes, spending the first ten minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to the previous night. Then he turned out the light, and within a minute or so was asleep. It was dark. He lay on his left side for a good hour. After that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment, and then turned over to sleep on his right side. Another hour after that his eyes flickered briefly, and he slightly scratched his nose, though there was still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back on to his left side, and so he whiled the night away, sleeping. At four he got up and went to the lavatory again. He opened the door to the lavatory, and so on. It's guff. It doesn't advance the action. It makes for nice fat books, such as the American market thrives on, but it doesn't actually get you anywhere. You don't, in short, want to know. But there are other omissions as well, besides the teeth-cleaning and trying to find fresh socks variety, and in some of these people have often seemed inordinately interested. What they want to know about all the stuff off in the wings with Arthur and Trillian, did that ever get you anywhere? To which the answer is, of course, mind your own business. And what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet Cricket? Just because the planet didn't have full-on as fire-dragons or dire straits doesn't mean to say that everyone just sat up every night reading. Or, to take a more specific example, what about the night after the committee-meeting party on prehistoric earth, when Arthur found himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly burning trees, in company with a beautiful young girl called Mella, recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily-lit tubes of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the planet Golgafrinchen? What then? What happened next? And the answer is, of course, that the book ended. The next one didn't resume the story till five years later, and you can claim some take-discretion-too-far. This Arthur Dent comes the cry from the furthest reaches of the galaxy, and has even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep-space probe thought to originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to contemplate. What is he, man or mouse? Is he interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life? Has he no spirit? Has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck? Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip on to the last chapter, which is a good bit and has Marvin in it.
 Chapter 13 That night at home as he was prancing around the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and Continually exploding with sudden laughter Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music kid one It was eight o'clock and he decided he would make himself force himself to listen to the whole record before he phoned her Maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow. That'll be the cool thing to do or next week sometime. Nope No games he wanted her and didn't care who knew it he definitely and absolutely Wanted her adored her longed for her wanted to do more things than there were names for with her He actually caught himself saying things like yippee as he pranced ridiculously around the house her eyes her hair her voice Everything he stopped he would put on the record of bagpipe music then he would call her Would he perhaps call her first? Nope, what he would do was this he would put on the record of bagpipe music He would listen to it every last banshee wail of it. Then he would call her. That was the correct order That was what he would do He was worried about touching things in case they blew up when he did so He picked up the record it failed to blow up He slipped it out of its cover. He opened the record player. He turned on the amp. They both survived He giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus onto the disc He sat and listened solemnly to a Scottish soldier he listened to Amazing Grace He listened to something about some Glen or other He thought about his miraculous lunchtime They had just been on the point of leaving when they were distracted by an awful outbreak of you whooing The appallingly palmed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid bird of the broken wing Everyone in the pub turned to them and seemed to be expecting some kind of response They hadn't listened to the bit about how pleased and happy Angie was going to be About the four pound thirty pence that everyone had helped to raise towards the cost of her kidney machine Had been vaguely aware that someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and took a moment or two to Cotton on to the fact that the you whooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number 37 Arthur discovered that he had he glanced angrily at his watch Van Church gave him a push go on She said go and get it Don't be bad-tempered Give him a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a call and tell me how it went I'll want to hear the record go on She flicked his arm and left The regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over effusive. It was after all merely an album of bagpipe music Arthur thought about it and listened to the music and kept on breaking into laughter
 Chapter 13 The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and clarity. Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of judging, and finally stopped to rest. The night was cool and balmy, the air pure, the sub-ether sensomatic totally silent. A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm, which combined with the soft fragrance of the woods, the quiet chatter of insects, and the brilliant light of the stars, to soothe their jangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had passed through rolling green hills and valleys, richly covered with grasses, wild-scented flowers, and tall thickly-leaved trees. The sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept them cool, and Ford Prefect had checked his sub-ether sensomatic at less and less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and less annoyance at his continued silence. He was beginning to think he liked it here. Cooler the night air was, they slept soundly and comfortably in the open, and awoke a few hours later with the light due for, feeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some small rolls into his satchel at Millieway's, and they had breakfasted off these before moving on. So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from and where they were going. Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one, a half-glimpse face amongst the trees watching them. It vanished at the moment they both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not alarmed. Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and ten minutes after that another. A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped short. Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about two dozen men and women. They stood still and quiet, facing Ford and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small children, and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches. Ford and Arthur held their breath. The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high. They all stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish foreheads, and bright clear eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers. Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly. For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither side making any move. The natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations. Nothing happened. For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen. After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened. "'Hello,' he said. The women drew their children slightly closer to them. The men made hardly any discernible move, and yet their whole disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome. It was not resented in any great degree. It was just not welcome. One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the group, and who might therefore have been their leader, stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene. "'Hello'—'Hello'—'Hello'—'Hello,' he said quietly. This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the Babelfish lodged in his ear, that he had ceased to be aware of it, and was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didn't seem to be working. Vague shadows of meaning had flickered at the back of his mind, but there was nothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly as it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language, and that the Babelfish was therefore powerless to help. He glanced at Ford, who was infinitely more experienced in these matters. �I think�, said Ford, out of the corner of his mouth, �he is asking us if we would mind walking on round the edge of the village.� A moment later a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm this. �Aaah!� continued the man-creature. �The general gist,� said Ford, �as far as I can make out, is that we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we would walk round his village rather than through it, it would make them all very happy.� �So what do we do?� �I think we make them happy,� said Ford. Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing. This seemed to go down very well with the natives, who bowed to them very slightly, and then went about their business. Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in their path, berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy green-skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears. So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, though the trees and bushes were laden with them. �Look at it this way,� Ford Prefect had said, �fruit and berries on strange planets either make you live or make you die. Therefore the point at which you start toying with them is when you are going to die if you don�t. That way you stay ahead. The secret of healthy hitchhiking is to eat junk food.� They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger. �Look at it this way,� said Ford. �Uh, yes?� said Arthur. �I�m trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it,� said Ford. The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the plump skins of the things which looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever seen, even in ice-cream commercials. �Why don�t we eat them and think about it afterwards?� he said. �Maybe that�s what they want us to do.� �All right. Look at it this way.� �Sounds good so far.� �It�s there for us to eat. Either it�s good or it�s bad. Either they want to feed us or to poison us. If it�s poisonous and we don�t eat it, they�ll just attack us some other way. If we don�t eat, we lose out either way.� �I like the way you�re thinking,� said Ford. �Now eat one.� Hesitantly Arthur picked up one of the things that looked like pears. �I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story,� said Ford. �Eh?� �You remember that Garden of Eden tree apple that bit, remember?� �Yes, of course I do.� �Well, your god-person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says, �Do what you like, guys, oh, but don�t eat the apple.� Surprise, surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting, �Gotcha!� Wouldn�t have made any difference if they hadn�t eaten it.� �Why not?� �Because if you�re dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them, you know perfectly well they won�t give up. They�ll get you in the end.� �What are you talking about?� �Never mind. Eat the fruit.� �You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden.� �Eat the fruit.� �Sounds quite like it, too.� Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear. �It�s a pear,� he said. A few minutes later, when they had eaten a lot, Ford Prefect turned round and called out, �Thank you. Thank you very much,� he called. �You�re very kind.� They went on their way. For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man-creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact. They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone. The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was where the sea started. Having no pressing calls on their time, they built a raft and crossed the sea. It was relatively calm, only about sixty miles wide, and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left. Life was, in short, ridiculously easy, and for a while at least they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them. When the craving for company became too great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles behind them. Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sabetha Sense-O-Matic more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken. On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they came to another sea, built another raft, and crossed it. This time it was harder going, the climate was getting colder. Arthur suspected a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect. The increasing difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that it was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly. Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast jagged snow-covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite into their bones. They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs, which Ford Prefect acquired by a technique he had once learnt from a couple of ex-Pralite monks running a mind-surfing resort in the hills of Hunian. The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all on the make, because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a form of devotional discipline are frankly sensational, and extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives. Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a while and smiling. After a while an animal—a deer, perhaps—would appear from out of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love—a love which reached out to embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from this transfigured man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it and break its neck. "'Pheromone control,' he said it was. You just have to know how to generate the right smell.'
 CHAPTER XXIV. Luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley, because Arthur hadn't done this sort of thing for a while, at least not deliberately, and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it. He swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on the jaw with a doorstep, and tumbled through the air, so suddenly stunned at what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done, that he completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground, and didn't. A nice trick, he thought to himself, if he can do it. The ground was hanging menacingly above his head. He tried not to think about the ground, what an extraordinarily big thing it was, and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop hanging there and suddenly fell on him. He tried to think nice thoughts about lemurs, and said which was exactly the right thing to do, because he couldn't at that moment remember precisely what a lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep in great majestic herds across the plains of wherever it was, or if that was wildebeest. So it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about, without simply resorting to an icky sort of general well-disposedness towards things, and all this kept his mind well occupied, while his body tried to adjust to the fact that it wasn't touching anything. A Mars Bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway. After a seeming moment of doubt and indecision, it eventually allowed the wind to ease it fluttering between him and the ground. Arthur! The ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he thought it was probably time to do something about that, such as fall away from it, which is what he did, slowly, very, very slowly. As he fell slowly, very, very slowly, he closed his eyes, carefully, so as not to jolt anything. The feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body. Once it had reached his feet, and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact that his eyes were now closed, and was not panicked by it, he slowly, very, very slowly, revolved his body one way and his mind the other. That should sort the ground out. He could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him quite cheerfully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly, very, very slowly, as from a deep and distant sleep, he opened his eyes. He had flown before, of course, flown many times on cricket, until all the bird-talk had driven him scatty, but this was different. Here he was, on his own world, quietly and without fuss, beyond a slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of things, being in the air. Ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac, and a few yards off to the right the yellow street-lights of Upper Street. Luckily the alleyway was dark, since the light which was supposed to see it through the night was on an ingenious time-switch which meant it came on just before lunch-time, and went off again as the evening was beginning to draw in. He was therefore safely shrouded in a blanket of dark obscurity. He slowly, very, very slowly, lifted his head to Fenchurch, who was standing in silent breathless amazement silhouetted in her upstairs doorway. Her face was inches from his. "'I was about to ask you,' she said in a low, trembly voice, "'what you were doing, but then I realised I could see what you were doing. You were flying.' So it seemed,' she went on, after a slight wandering pause, "'like a bit of a silly question.' Arthur said, "'Can you do it?' "'No.' "'Would you like to try?' She bit her lip and shook her head, not so much to say no, but just in sheer bewilderment she was shaking like a leaf. "'It's quite easy,' urged Arthur, "'if you don't know how. That's the important bit. Be not at all sure how you're doing it.' Just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the alleyway, fell upwards quite dramatically, and bobbed back down to her like a banknote on a breath of wind. "'Ask me how I did that.' "'How did you do that?' "'No idea. Not a clue.' She shrugged in bewilderment. "'So how can I?' Arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand. "'I want you to try,' he said, "'to step onto my hand. Just one foot.' "'What?' "'Try it.' Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she was trying to step onto the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in mid-air, she stepped onto his hand. "'Now the other,' he said. "'What?' "'Take the weight off your back foot.' "'I can't. Try it.' "'Like this?' "'Like that.' Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she stopped telling herself what what she was doing was like, because she had a feeling she didn't altogether want to know. She fixed her eyes very, very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the decrepit warehouse opposite, which had been annoying her for weeks, because it was clearly going to fall off, and she wondered if anyone was going to do anything about it, or whether she ought to say something to somebody, and didn't think for a moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasn't standing on anything at all. "'Now,' said Arthur, "'take your weight off your left foot.' She thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company, who had their offices round the corner, and took her weight off her left foot, so she should probably go and see them about the gutter. "'Now,' said Arthur, "'take the weight off your right foot.' "'I can't. Try.' She hadn't seen the guttering from quite this angle before, and it looked to her now as if, as well as the mud and gunge up there, there might also be a bird's nest. If she leaned forward just a little, and took her weight off her right foot, she could probably see it more clearly. Arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was trying to steal her bicycle. He particularly didn't want to get involved in an argument at the moment, and hoped that the guy would do it quietly and not look up. He had the quiet, shifty look of someone who habitually stole bicycles in alleys, and habitually didn't expect to find their owners hovering several feet above them. He was relaxed by both these habits, and went about his job with purpose and concentration, and when he found that the bike was unarguably bound by hoops of tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete, he peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way. Arthur let out a long-held breath. "'See what a piece of eggshell I have found you,' said Fenchurch in his ear.
 Chapter 7 The Bistromatic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with improbability factors. Bistromatics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers. Just as Einstein observed that time was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement in space, and that space was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement in time, so we just now realise that numbers are not absolute but depend on the observer's movement in restaurants. The first non-absolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the show, match, party or gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up. The second non-absolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts, a reciproverse exclusion, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive. Reciproverse exclusions now play a vital part in many branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy, and also form the basic equation used to engineer the somebody else's problem field. The third and most mysterious piece of non-absoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table, and what they are each prepared to pay for. The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in this field. The baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point remained uninvestigated for centuries, simply because no one took them seriously. They were at the time put down to such things as politeness, rudeness, meanness, flashness, tiredness, emotionality, or the lateness of the hour, and completely forgotten about on the following morning. They were never tested under laboratory conditions, of course, because they never occurred in laboratories, not in reputable laboratories at least. And so it was only with the advent of pocket computers that the startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this. Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the universe. This single fact took the scientific world by storm. It completely revolutionized it. So many mathematical conferences got held in such good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died of obesity and heart failure, and the science of maths was put back by years. Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be understood. To begin with, it had been too stark, too crazy, too much what the man in the street would have said, oh, yes, I could have told you that about. Then some phrases like interactive subjectivity frameworks were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get on with it. The small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the major research institutes, singing strange chants to the effect that the universe was only a figment of its own imagination, were eventually given a street theatre grant and went away.
 Chapter 11 April showers I hate especially However noncommittally Arthur grunted, the man seemed determined to talk to him. He wondered if he should get up and move to another table, but there didn't seem to be one free in the whole cafeteria. He stirred his coffee fiercely. "'Bloody April showers! Hate, hate, hate!' Arthur stared, frowning, out of the window. A light, sunny spray of rain hung over the motorway. Two months he had been back now. Slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy. People had such extraordinarily short memories, including him. Eight years of crazed wanderings round the galaxy now seemed to him not so much like a bad dream as like a film he had videotaped from the TV and now kept in the back of a cupboard without bothering to watch. One effect that still lingered, though, was his joy at being back. Now that the earth's atmosphere had closed over its head for good, he thought, wrongly, everything within it gave him extraordinary pleasure. Looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had to protest. "'Well, I like them,' he said suddenly, 'and for all the obvious reasons, they're light and refreshing. They sparkle and make you feel good.' The man snorted derisively. "'That's what they all say,' he said, and glowered darkly from his corner seat. He was a lorry driver. Arthur knew this because his opening unprovoked remark had been, "'I'm a lorry driver. I hate driving in the rain. Ironic, isn't it? Bloody ironic!' If there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, Arthur had not been able to divine it, and had merely given a little grunt, affable but not encouraging. But the man had not been deterred then and was not deterred now. "'They all say that about bloody April showers,' he said. "'So bloody nice, so bloody refreshing, in such charming bloody weather.' He leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say something extraordinary about the Government. "'What I want to know is this,' he said. "'If it's going to be nice weather, why—' he almost spat, "'—can't it be nice without bloody raining?' Arthur gave up. He decided to leave his coffee, which was too hot to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold. "'Well, there you go,' he said, and instead got up himself. "'Bye!' He stopped off at the service-station shop, then walked back through the car-park, making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain on his face. There was even, he noticed, a faint rainbow glistening over the Devon Hills. He enjoyed that too. He climbed into his battered but adored old black Golf G.T.I., squealed the tyres, and headed out past the islands of petrol-pumps and on to the slip-road back towards the motorway. He was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the earth had closed finally and for ever above his head. He was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels had dragged him. He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily, dirty, rainbow-hung earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, lost in the unimaginable infinity of the universe. He drove on, humming, being wrong about all these things. The reason he was wrong was standing by the slip-road under a small umbrella. His jaw sagged. He sprained his ankle against the brake-pedal and skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over. "'Fenny!' he shouted. Having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit her instead with the car-door as he leant across and flung it open at her. It caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella, which then bowled wildly away across the road. "'Shit!' yelled Arthur, as helpful as he could, leapt out of his own door, narrowly avoided being run down by McKenna's all-weather haulage, and watched in horror as it ran down Fenny's umbrella instead. The lorry swept along the motorway and away. The umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy-long-legs, expiring sadly on the ground. Tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little. He picked it up. "'Ah!' he said. There didn't seem to be a lot of point in offering the thing back to her. "'How did you know my name?' she said. "'Oh, well,' he said, "'look, I'll get you another one.' He looked at her and tailed off. She was tallish, with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and serious face. Standing still, alone, she seemed almost sombre, like a statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a formal garden. She seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked as if she was looking at. But when she smiled, as she did now, it was as if she suddenly arrived from somewhere. Warmth and life flooded into her face, an impossibly graceful movement into her body. The effect was very disconcerting, and it disconcerted Arthur like hell. She grinned, tossed her bag into the back, and swivelled herself into the front seat. "'Don't worry about the umbrella,' she said to him as she climbed in. "'It was my brother's, and he can't have liked it, or he wouldn't have given it to me.' She laughed and pulled on her seat-belt. "'You're not a friend of my brother's, are you?' "'No.' Her voice was the only part of her which didn't say, "'Good!' Her physical presence there in the car—his car—was quite extraordinary to Arthur. He felt, as he let the car pull slowly away, that he could hardly think or breathe, and hoped that neither of these functions were vital to his driving, or they were in trouble. So what he had experienced in the other car—her brother's car—the night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare years in the stars, had not been the unbalance of the moment, or, if it had been, it was at least twice as unbalanced now, and quite liable to fall off whatever it is that well-balanced people are supposed to be balancing on. "'So,' he said, hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting start, "'he was supposed to pick me up, my brother, but phone to say he couldn't make it. I asked about buses, but the man started to look at a calendar rather than a time-table, so I decided to hitch. So—so,' said Arthur. "'So here I am, and what I would like to know is how you know my name.' "'Perhaps we ought to first sort out,' said Arthur, looking back over his shoulder, as he eased his car into the motorway traffic, "'where I'm taking you.' "'Very close,' he hoped, or a long way. Close would mean she lived near him. A long way would mean he could drive her there. "'I'd like to go to Taunton,' she said. "'Please, if that's all right. It's not far. You can drop me at—' "'You live in Taunton?' he said, hoping that he managed to sound merely curious rather than ecstatic. Taunton was wonderfully close to him. He could—' "'No, London,' she said. There's a train in just under an hour.' It was the worst thing possible. Taunton was only minutes away out the motorway. He wondered what to do, and while he was wondering, with horror, heard himself saying, "'Oh, I can take you to London, and let me take you to London.' "'Bungling idiot! Why on earth had he said let in that stupid way? He was behaving like a twelve-year-old. "'Are you going to London?' she asked. "'I—I wasn't,' he said, but—'Bungling idiot!' "'It's very kind of you,' she said, but really, no. I like to go by train.' And suddenly she was gone, or rather that part of her which brought her to life was gone. She looked rather distantly out of the window, and hummed lightly to herself. He couldn't believe it. Thirty seconds into the conversation, and already he'd blown it. "'Grown men,' he told himself, in flat contradiction of centuries of accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave, "'do not behave like this.' "'Taunton, five miles,' said the signpost. He gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled. He was going to have to do something dramatic. "'Fenny,' he said. She glanced round sharply at him. "'You haven't told me how—' "'Listen,' said Arthur. "'I will tell you that the story is rather strange—very strange.' She was still looking at him, but said nothing. "'Listen.' "'You said that. Did I—oh, there are things I must talk to you about, and things I must tell you—a story I must tell you which would—' He was thrashing about. He wanted to say something along the lines of, "'Thy knotted and combined locks to part, and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine,' but didn't think he could carry it off, and didn't like the hedgehog reference. "'Which would take more than five miles,' he settled for in the end. Rather lamely, he was afraid. "'Well—' "'Just supposing,' he said. "'Just supposing—' He didn't know what was coming next, so he thought he'd just sit back and listen. "'That there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important to me, and that you didn't know it. I was very important to you, but it all went for nothing, because we only had five miles, and I was a stupid idiot at not knowing how to say something very important to someone I'd only just met, and not crash into lorries at the same time. "'What would you say?' he paused helplessly, and looked at her. "'I should do—' "'Watch the road!' she yelped. "'Shit!' He narrowly avoided careering into the sight of a hundred Italian washing-machines and a German lorry. "'I think,' she said with a momentary sigh of relief, "'you should buy me a drink before my train goes.'
 XX. The purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the summer, especially in parks," said the voice earnestly, "'is to make girls' breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye. I am convinced that this is the case.' Arthur and Fanchurch giggled about this to each other as they passed. She hugged him more tightly for a moment. "'And I am certain,' said the frizzy, ginger-haired youth with the long, thin nose, who was expostulating from his deckchair by the side of the serpentine, "'that if one worked the argument through, one would find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic from everything,' he insisted to his thin, dark-haired companion, who was slumped in the next-door deckchair, feeling dejected about his spots, "'that Darwin was going on about. This is certain. This is indisputable.' And,' he added, "'I love it.'" He turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at Fanchurch. Arthur steered her away and could feel her silently quaking. "'Next guest,' she said, when she had stopped giggling. "'Come on.' "'All right,' he said. "'Your elbow—your left elbow. There's something wrong with your left elbow.' "'Wrong again,' she said. "'Completely wrong. You're on completely the wrong track.' The summer sun was sinking through the trees in the park, looking as if—let's not mince words. Hyde Park is stunning. Everything about it is stunning, except for the rubbish on Monday mornings. Even the ducks are stunning. Anyone who can go through Hyde Park on a summer's evening and not feel moved by it is probably going through in an ambulance with a sheet pulled over their face. It is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they do elsewhere. Arthur and Fanchurch found a man in shorts practising the bagpipes to himself under a tree. The piper paused to chase off an American couple who had tried timidly to put some coins on the box his bagpipes came in. "'No!' he shouted at them. 'Go away! I'm only practising.' He started resolutely to re-inflate his bag, but even the noise this made could not disfigure their mood. Arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downwards. "'I don't think it can be your bottom,' he said after a while. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with that at all.' "'Yes,' she agreed. 'There's absolutely nothing wrong with my bottom.' They kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and practised on the other side of the tree. "'I'll tell you a story,' said Arthur. "'Good.' They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath the stunning ducks. "'A story,' said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her. "'Which will tell something of the sort of things that happened to me. It's absolutely true,' said Arthur. "'You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be something that happened to their wife's cousin's best friend, but actually probably got made up somewhere along the line. Well, it's like one of those stories, except that it actually happened, and I know it actually happened, because the person it actually happened to was me. "'I'd like the raffle tickets,' said Fenchurch. Arthur laughed. "'Yes. I had a train to catch,' he went on. "'I arrived at the station. Did I ever tell you,' interrupted Fenchurch, "'what happened to my parents at a station?' "'Yes,' said Arthur, "'you did. Just checking.' Arthur glanced at his watch. "'I suppose we could think of getting back,' he said. "'Tell me the story,' said Fenchurch firmly. "'You arrived at the station.' "'I was about twenty minutes early,' said Arthur. "'I'd got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it's at least equally possible,' he added, after a moment's reflection, that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. It hadn't occurred to me before.' "'Get on with it,' Fenchurch laughed. "'So I bought a newspaper to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.' "'You do the crossword?' "'Yes.' "'Which one?' "'The Guardian, usually.' "'I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer the Times. Did you solve it?' "'What?' "'The crossword and the Guardian.' "'I haven't had a chance to look at it yet,' said Arthur. "'I'm still trying to buy the coffee.' "'All right, then. Buy the coffee.' "'I'm buying it. I'm also,' said Arthur, "'buying some biscuits.' "'What sort?' "'Rich tea.' "'Good choice.' "'I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like, because this is some time ago, and I can't remember. It was probably round. All right. "'So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my left, the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits.' "'I see it perfectly,' said Fenchurch. "'What you don't see,' said Arthur, "'because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He's sitting there opposite me.' "'What's he like?' "'Oh, perfectly ordinary. Briefcase, business suit. He didn't look,' said Arthur, "'as if he was about to do anything weird.' "'Ah, I know the type. What did he do?' "'He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and—' "'What?' "'Eat it.' "'What?' "'He ate it.' "'Eat it!' Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. "'What on earth did you do?' "'Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,' said Arthur, "'to ignore it.' "'What? Why?' "'Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for, is it? I searched my soul and discovered there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.' "'Well, you could,' Fenchurch thought about it. "'I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?' "'I stared furiously at the crossword,' said Arthur. "'Couldn't do a single clue. Took a sip of coffee. It was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,' he added, that the packet was already mysteriously open. "'But you're fighting back, taking a tough line.' "'After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit, Arthur said, it stays eaten.' "'So what did he do?' "'Took another one. Honestly,' insisted Arthur. "'This is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit. He ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.' Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. "'And the problem was,' said Arthur, "'that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. I mean, what do you say? Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing. It doesn't work. No, I ignored it. If anything, with more vigour than previously.' "'My man!' said Fenchurch. "'Stirred at the crossword again. Still couldn't budge a bit of it. So showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin's Day—' "'What?' "'I went into the breach again. I took,' said Arthur, "'another biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met. Like this. Yes—well, no, not quite like that. But they met, just for an instant. And we both looked away. "'But I am here to tell you,' said Arthur, "'there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table at about this time.' "'I can imagine. We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me—' "'The whole packet?' said Fenchurch. "'Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.' "'Gladiators,' said Fenchurch, "'would have had to do it in the sun, more physically gruelling.' "'There is that. So when the empty packet was lying dead between us, the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper—yes?—were my biscuits.' "'What?' said Fenchurch. "'What? True.' "'No!' she gasped, and tossed herself back on the grass, laughing. She sat up again. "'You complete nitwit!' she hooted. "'You almost completely and utterly foolish person!' She pushed him backwards, rolled over him, kissed him, and rolled off again. He was surprised at how light she was. "'Now you tell me a story,' said Arthur. "'I thought,' she said, putting on a low husky voice, "'that you were very keen to get back.' "'No hurry,' he said airily. "'I want you to tell me a story.' She looked out over the lake and pondered. "'All right,' she said. "'It's only a short one, and not funny like yours. But—anyway, "'She looked down. Arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of moments. The air seemed to stand still around them, waiting. Arthur wished that the air would go away and mind its own business. "'When I was a kid,' she said—these stories always start like this, don't they?—'When I was a kid—' Anyway, this is the bit where the girl suddenly goes when I was a kid and starts to unburden herself. We have got to that bit. When I was a kid I had this picture hanging over the foot of my bed. "'What do you think of it so far?' "'I like it,' said Arthur. I think it's moving well. You are getting the bedroom interest in nice and early. We could probably do some development with the picture.' "'It was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like,' she said. "'But don't. Full of endearing little animals doing endearing things, you know.' "'I know. I was plagued with them, too. Rabbits in waistcoats.' "'Exactly. These rabbits were in fact on a raft, as were assorted rats and owls. There may even have been a reindeer. "'On the raft—on the raft—' and a boy was sitting on the raft. "'Among the rabbits in waistcoats and owls and the reindeer,' said Arthur. "'Precisely there. A boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety. "'The picture worried me, I must say. There was an otter swimming in front of the raft, and I used to lie awake at night worrying about this otter having to pull the raft with all those wretched animals on it, who shouldn't even be on a raft, and the otter had such a thin tail to pull it with. I thought it must hurt pulling it all the time. It worried me—not badly, but just vaguely, all the time. "'Then one day—and remember I had been looking at this picture every night for years—I suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail. Never seen it before. The otter was fine. He was just swimming along.' She shrugged. "'Good story,' she said. "'And ends weakly,' said Arthur. "'Leaves the audience crying, Yes, but what of it? Fine up till there, but it needs a final sting before the credits.' Fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs. It was just such a sudden revelation—years of almost unnoticed worry just dropping away, like taking off heavy weights, like black and white becoming colour, like a dry stick suddenly being watered—a sudden shift of perspective that says, "'Put away your worries. The world is a good and perfect place. It is in fact very easy.' "'You probably think I'm saying that because I'm going to say I felt like that this afternoon or something, don't you?' "'Well, I—' said Arthur, his composure suddenly shattered. "'Well, it's all right,' she said. "'I did. That's exactly what I felt. But you see, I felt that before, even stronger, incredibly strongly.' "'I'm afraid I'm a bit of a one,' she said, gazing off into the distance for sudden, startling revelations. Arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser, therefore, for the moment not to try. "'It was very odd,' she said. "'Much as one of the pursuing Egyptians might have said that the behaviour of the Red Sea when Moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side. "'Very odd,' she repeated. "'For days before the strangest feeling had been building in me, as if I was going to give birth. And no, it wasn't like that, in fact. It was more as if I was being connected into something bit by bit. Not even that. It was as if the whole of the earth, through me, was going to—' "'Does the number,' said Arthur gently, "'forty-two' mean anything to you?' "'What? No, what are you talking about?' exclaimed Fenchurch. "'Just a thought,' murmured Arthur. "'Arthur, I mean this. This is very real to me. This is serious.' "'I was being perfectly serious,' said Arthur. "'It's just the universe I'm never quite sure about.' "'What do you mean by that?' "'Tell me the rest of it,' he said. "'Don't worry if it sounds odd. Believe me, you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff,' he added. "'That is odd. And I don't mean biscuits.' She nodded and seemed to believe him. Suddenly she gripped his arm. "'It was so simple,' she said, so wonderfully and extraordinarily simple, when it came. "'What was it?' said Arthur quietly. "'Arthur, you see,' she said, "'that's what I no longer know. And the loss is unbearable. If I try to think back to it, it all just goes flickery and jumpy. And if I try too hard I get as far as the teacup and I just black out.' "'What?' "'Well, like your story,' she said. The best bit happened in a café. I was sitting there having a cup of tea. This was after days of this build-up, the feeling of becoming connected up. I think I was buzzing gently and there was some work going on at a building site opposite the café and I was watching it through the window over the rim of my teacup, which I always find is the nicest way of watching other people working. And suddenly there it was in my mind, this message from somewhere. And it was so simple. It made such sense of everything. I just sat up and thought, Oh! Oh! Well, that's all right then. I was so startled I almost dropped my teacup. In fact, I think I did drop it. Yes,' she added thoughtfully, ''I'm sure I did. How much sense am I making?' It was fine up to the bit about the teacup. She shook her head and shook it again as if trying to clear it, which is what she was trying to do. "'Well, that's it,' she said. Fine up to the bit about the teacup. That was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world exploded. "'What?' "'I know it sounds crazy and everybody says it was hallucinations, but if that was hallucinations then I have hallucinations in big screen 3D with 16-track Dolby stereo and should probably hire myself out to people who are bored of shark movies. It was as if the ground was literally ripped from under my feet and—' And she patted the grass lightly as if for reassurance and then seemed to change her mind about what she was going to say. "'And I woke up in hospital. I suppose I've been in and out ever since. And that's why I have an instinctive nervousness,' she said, of sudden startling revelations that everything's going to be all right.' She looked up at him. Arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange anomalies surrounding his return to his home world, or rather had consigned them to that part of his mind marked Things to Think About, Urgent. Here is the world, he had told himself, here, for whatever reason, is the world, and here it stays, with me on it. But now it seemed to go swimmy around him, as it had that night in the car when Fenchurch's brother had told him the silly stories of the CIA agent in the reservoir. The French Embassy went swimmy, the trees went swimmy, the lake went swimmy, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed by because a grey goose had just landed on it. The geese were having a great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know the questions to. "'Anyway,' said Fenchurch suddenly and brightly, with a wide-eyed smile, "'there is something wrong with part of me, and you've got to find out what it is. We'll go home.' Arthur shook his head. "'What's the matter?' she said. Arthur had shaken his head not to disagree with her suggestion, which he thought was a truly excellent one, one of the world's great suggestions, but because he was just for a moment trying to free himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was least expecting it the universe would suddenly leap out from behind a door and go boo at him. "'I'm just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind,' said Arthur. "'You say you felt as if the earth actually exploded?' "'Yes,' said Fenchurch, "'more than felt.' "'Which is what everybody says,' he said hesitantly, "'is hallucinations.' "'Yes, but, Arthur, that's ridiculous. People think if you just say hallucinations it explains anything you want it to explain, and eventually whatever it is you can't understand will just go away. It's just a word. It doesn't explain anything. It doesn't explain why the dolphins disappeared.' "'No,' said Arthur. "'No,' he added thoughtfully. "'No,' he added again, even more thoughtfully. "'What?' he said at last. "'It doesn't explain the dolphins disappearing.' "'No,' said Arthur. "'I see that. Which dolphins do you mean?' "'What do you mean which dolphins? I'm talking about when all the dolphins disappeared.' She put her hand on his knee, which made him realise that the tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his back, and must instead be one of those nasty creepy feelings he so often got when people were trying to explain things to him. "'The dolphins?' "'Yes.' "'All the dolphins?' said Arthur. "'Disappeared?' "'Yes. The dolphins. You're saying that the dolphins all disappeared. Is this,' said Arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point, 'what you're saying?' "'Arthur, where have you been, for heaven's sake? The dolphins all disappeared on the same day I—' She stared at him intently in his startled eyes. "'What?' "'No dolphins. All gone. Vanished.' She searched his face. "'Did you really not know that?' It was clear from his startled expression that he did not. "'Where did they go?' he asked. "'No one knows. That's what vanished means.' She paused. "'Well, there is one man who says he knows about it, but everyone says he lives in California,' she said, ''and is mad. I was thinking of going to see him because he seems the only lead I've got on what happened to me.' She shrugged and then looked at him long and quietly. She laid her hand on the side of his face. "'I really would like to know where you've been,' she said. "'I think something terrible happened to you then as well, and that's why we recognized each other.' She glanced around the park, which was now being gathered into the clutches of dusk. "'Well,' she said, ''now you've got someone you can tell.' Arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh. "'It is,' he said, "'a very long story.' Fernchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag. "'Is it anything to do with this?' she said. The thing she took out of her bag was battered and travel-worn, as it had been hurled into the historic rivers, baked under the sun that shines so readily on the deserts of Cacophon, half buried in the marbled sands that fringe the heady-vapoured oceans of Santraginus V, frozen on the glaciers of the moon of Jaglan Bita, sat on, kicked around spaceships, scuffed and generally abused, and since its makers had thought that these were exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it, they had thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover, and written on it in large friendly letters the words, "'Don't panic.' "'Where did you get this?' said Arthur, startled, taking it from her. "'Ah,' she said, "'I thought it was yours. In Russell's car that night you dropped it.' "'Have you been to many of these places?' Arthur drew the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy from its cover. It was like a small, thin, flexible lap-computer. He tapped some buttons till the screen flared with text. "'A few,' he said. "'Can we go to them?' "'What? No,' said Arthur abruptly, then relented, but relented warily. "'Do you want to?' he said, hoping for the answer no. It was an act of great generosity on his part not to say, "'You don't want to, do you?' which expects it. "'Yes,' she said. "'I want to know what the message was that I lost and where it came from, "'because I don't think,' she added, standing up and looking around the increasing gloom of the park, "'that it came from here. "'I'm not even sure,' she further added, slipping her arm around Arthur's waist, "'that I know where here is.'
 CHAPTER XII A short while later he was running across the plain in the direction of the ruined city. The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs, and he frequently stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling. Night was beginning to fall, too, and the rough ground was treacherous. The elation of his recent experience was still with him, though. The whole universe—he had seen the whole universe stretching to infinity around him—everything, and with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it. Having a conceited ego is one thing, actually being told by a machine is another. He didn't have time to reflect on this matter. Gargavar had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing so—enough time for Zephod to make a break and find somewhere to hide. What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that he was the most important person in the universe gave him the confidence to believe that something would turn up. Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for optimism. He ran on and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city. He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes. The buildings he passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of them. Where could he hide? He hurried on. After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the hole surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main building still seemed reasonably solid, and Zephod turned off to see if it might provide him with—well, with anything. He approached the building. Along one side of it—the front, it would seem, since it faced a wide, concreted apron area—were three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these was open, and towards this Zephod ran. Inside all was gloom, dust, and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over everything. Part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches over the floor. Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris. The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous, sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons. They were all spacecraft, all derelict. Zephod wandered in frustration amongst the hulks. There was nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable. Even the mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to collapse further into itself. Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly larger than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed unbroken. Zephod approached it with interest, and as he did so he tripped over an old feed-line. He tried to toss the feed-line aside, and to his surprise discovered that it was still connected to the ship. To his utter astonishment he realized that the feed-line was also humming slightly. He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then backed down at the feed-line in his hands. He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on his hands and knees he followed the feed-line to the point where it connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight humming vibration was more distinct. His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid an ear against the ship's side. He could hear only a faint indeterminate noise. He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all about him, and found a short length of tubing and a non-biodegradable plastic cup. Out of this he fashioned a crude stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship. What he heard made his brains turn somersaults. Trans-Stella Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers for the continuing delay to this flight. We are currently awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemon-soaked paper napkins for your comfort, refreshment, and hygiene during the journey. Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The cabin crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again. Zafot staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship. He walked around for a few moments in a daze. In so doing he suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging, but by only one support, from the ceiling above him. It was covered with grime, but some of the figures were still discernible. Zafot's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief calculations. His eyes widened. Nine hundred years! he breathed to himself. That was how late the ship was. Two minutes later he was on board. As he stepped out of the airlock the air that greeted him was cool and fresh. The air conditioning was still working. The lights were still on. He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow corridor and stepped nervously down it. Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him. Please return to your seats, sir, said the android stewardess, and turning her back on him she walked on down the corridor in front of him. When his heart had started beating again he followed her. She opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through. He followed her through the door. They were now in the passenger compartment and Zafot's heart stopped still again for a moment. In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat. The passenger's hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were long, the men wore beards. All of them were quite clearly alive, but sleeping. Zafot had the creeping horrors. He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was halfway down the aisle the stewardess had reached the other end. She turned and spoke. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, she said sweetly. Thank you for bearing with us during the slight delay. We will be taking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to wake up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits. There was a slight hum. At that moment all the passengers awoke. They awoke screaming and clawing at the straps and life-support systems that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and bawled and hollered till Zafot thought his ears would shatter. They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up the aisle, placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits in front of each one of them. Then one of them rose from his seat. He turned and looked at Zafot. Zafot's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get off. He turned and ran from the bedlam. He plunged through the door and back into the corridor. The man pursued him. He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the entrance chamber and beyond. He arrived on the flight deck, slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the door, breathing hard. Within seconds a hand started beating on the door. From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him. Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return to your seat and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits are being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please return to your seat. Zafot said nothing. He breathed hard. Behind him the hand continued to knock on the door. Please return to your seat, repeated the autopilot. Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. I'm not a passenger, panted Zafot. Please return to your seat. I'm not a passenger, shouted Zafot again. Please return to your seat. I'm not a... Hello, can you hear me? Please return to your seat. You're the autopilot, said Zafot. Yes, said the voice from the flight console. You're in charge of this ship? Yes, said the voice again. There has been a delay. Passengers are to be kept temporarily in suspended animation for their comfort and convenience. Coffee and biscuits are served every year, after which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their continued comfort and convenience. Departure will take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize for the delay. Zafot moved away from the door, on which the pounding had now ceased. He approached the flight console. Delay? He cried. Have you seen the world outside this ship? It's a wasteland, a desert. Civilization's been and gone, man. There are no lemon-soaked paper napkins on their way from anywhere. The statistical likelihood, continued the autopilot primly, is that other civilizations will arise. There will one day be lemon-soaked paper napkins. Till then, there will be a short delay. Please return to your seat. But... But at that moment the door opened. Zafot spun round to see the man who had pursued him, standing there. He carried a large briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had no beard and no long fingernails. Zafot Bibelbrox, he said. My name is Zarniwoop. I believe you wanted to see me. Zafot Bibelbrox wittered. His mouth said foolish things. He dropped into a chair. Oh, man, oh, man! Where did you spring from? He said. I have been waiting here for you, he said in a business-like tone. He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair. I am glad you followed instructions, he said. I was a bit nervous that you might have left my office by the door rather than the window. Then you would have been in trouble. Zafot shook his head at him and burbled. When you entered the door of my office you entered my electronically synthesized universe, he explained. If you had left by the door you would have been back in the real one. The artificial one works from here. He patted the briefcase smugly. Zafot glared at him with resentment and loathing. What's the difference? he muttered. Nothing, said Zarniwoop. They are identical. No, except that I think the frog-star fighters are grey in the real universe. What's going on? spat Zafot. Simple, said Zarniwoop. His self-assurance and smugness made Zafot seethe. Ah, very simple, repeated Zarniwoop. I discovered the coordinates at which this man could be found, the man who rules the universe, and discovered that his world was protected by an improbability field. To protect my secret and myself I retreated to the safety of this totally artificial universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner. I was secure. Meanwhile you and I— You and I? said Zafot angrily. You mean I knew you? Oh yes, said Zarniwoop. We knew each other well. I had no taste, said Zafot, and resumed a sullen silence. Meanwhile you and I arranged that you would steal the improbability drive-ship, the only one which could reach the ruler's world, and bring it to me here. This you have now done, I trust, and I congratulate you. He smiled a tight little smile which Zafot wanted to hit with a brick. Oh, and in case you are wondering, added Zarniwoop, this universe was created specially for you to come to. You are therefore the most important person in this universe. You would never, he said with an even more brickable smile, have survived the total perspective vortex in the real one. Shall we go? Where? said Zafot sullenly. He felt collapsed. To your ship, the Heart of Gold, you did bring it, I trust? No. Where is your jacket? Zafot looked at him in mystification. My jacket? I took it off. It's outside. Good. We will go and find it. Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zafot to follow him. When they looked in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits. It has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you, said Zarniwoop. How pleasant for you, bawled Zafot. How do you think? Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open. A few feet away from them, they could see Zafot's jacket lying in the debris. Very remarkable and very powerful ship, said Zarniwoop. Watch. As they watched, the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged. It split. It ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that Zafot had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing. It grew. It continued to grow. It reached after two minutes its full size. At an improbability level, said Zarniwoop, of, oh, I don't know, but something very, very large. Zafot swayed. You mean I had it with me all the time? Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it. He twisted a single switch inside it. Goodbye, artificial universe, he said. Hello, real one. Scene before them shimmered briefly and reappeared exactly as before. You see, said Zarniwoop, exactly the same. You mean, repeated Zafot tautly, that I had it with me all the time? Oh, yes, said Zarniwoop. Of course. I mean, that was the whole point. That's it, said Zafot. You can count me out. From here on in you can count me out. I've had all I want of this. You play your own games. I'm afraid you cannot leave, said Zarniwoop. You are entwined in the improbability field. You cannot escape. He smiled the smile Zafot had wanted to hit, and this time Zafot hit it.
 Chapter 4 Ten light-years away, Gag Halfront jacked up his smile by several notches. As he watched the picture on his vision-screen, relayed across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon ship, he saw the final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke. Good, he thought. The end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had ordered on the planet Earth, he thought. The final end of this dangerous—to the psychiatric profession, and subversive—also to the psychiatric profession—experiment to find the question to the ultimate answer of life, the universe, and everything, he thought. There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and in the morning they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered, and highly profitable patients, secure in the knowledge the meaning of life would not now be once and for all well and truly sorted out, he thought. Family's always embarrassing, isn't it? said Ford to Zaphod, as the smoke began to clear. He paused and looked about. Where's Zaphod? he said. Arthur and Trillian looked about blankly. They were pale and shaken, and didn't know where Zaphod was. Marvin? said Ford. Where's Zaphod? A moment later he said, Where's Marvin? The robot's corner was empty. The ship was utterly silent. It lay in thick black space. Occasionally it rocked and swayed. Every instrument was dead. Every vision screen was dead. They consulted the computer. It said, I regret I have been temporarily closed to all communication. Meanwhile, here is some light music. They turned off the light music. They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment and alarm. Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any trace of Zaphod or of Marvin. One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the Nutrimatic machine was located. On the delivery plate of the Nutrimatic drink synthesizer was a small tray on which sat three bone-china cups and saucers, a bone-china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying, Wait.
 XXIII. The battle raged on about the Star of Zaxxis. Hundreds of the fierce and horribly beweaponed Zursla ships had now been smashed and wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver Zaxxician ship was able to deploy. Part of the moon had gone too, blasted away by the same blazing force-guns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed through it. The Zursla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of the Zaxxician ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon, when the Zaxxician ship, in hurtling pursuit behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday, and left the field of battle. All was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment, but the ship was gone. With the stupendous powers at its command, it flitted across vast tracts of irrationally shaped space quickly, effortlessly, and above all quietly. Deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance hatchway, Ford Prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old haunts. He dreamed at one point of his slumbers in New York. In his dream he was walking late at night along the East Side, beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that new life-forms are now emerging from it spontaneously, demanding welfare and voting rights. One of these now floated past, waving. Ford waved back. The thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank. "'Hi,' it said. "'I've just been created. I'm completely new to the universe in all respects. Is there anything you can tell me?' "'Phew,' said Ford, a little nonplussed. "'I can tell you where some bars are, I guess. What about love and happiness? I sense deep needs for things like that,' it said, waving its tentacles. "'Got any leads there?' "'You can get something like what you require,' said Ford, on Seventh Avenue. "'I instinctively feel,' said the creature urgently, "'that I need to be beautiful. Am I?' "'You're pretty direct, aren't you?' "'Well, no point in mucking about. Now, am I?' The thing was oozing all over the place now, squelching and blubbering. The nearby wino was getting interested. "'To me,' said Ford, no. "'But listen,' he added after a moment. "'Most people make out, you know. Are there any like you down there?' "'Search me, buster,' said the creature. "'As I said, I'm new here. Life is entirely strange to me. What's it like?' Here was something that Ford felt he could speak about with authority. "'Life,' he said, "'is like a grapefruit.' "'Uh, how so?' "'Well, it's sort of orangey-yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet and squidgy in the middle. It's got pips inside, too. Oh, and some people have half a one for breakfast.' "'Is there anyone else out there I can talk to?' "'I expect so,' said Ford. "'Ask a policeman.' Deep in his bunk Ford Prefect wriggled and turned on to his other side. It wasn't his favourite type of dream, because it didn't have Eccentric Golumbitz, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six in it, whom many of his dreams did feature. But at least it was a dream. At least he was asleep.
 Chapter 8 So do we just sit here or what? said Zayford angrily. What do these guys out here want? You, Beeblebrox, said Rooster, they're going to take you to the Frogstar, the most totally evil world in the galaxy. Oh yeah? said Zayford. Well, they'll have to come and get me first. They have come and got you, said Rooster. Look out of the window. Zayford looked and gaped. The ground's going away, he gasped. Where are they taking the ground? They're taking the building, said Rooster. We're airborne. Clouds streaked past the office window. Out in the open air again, Zayford could see the ring of dark green Frogstar fighters round the uprooted tower of the building. A network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower in a firm grip. Zayford shook his head in perplexity. What have I done to deserve this, he said. I walk into a building, they take it away. It's not what you've done they're worried about, said Rooster. It's what you're going to do. Well, don't I get a say in that? You did, years ago. You'd better hold on. We're in for a fast and bumpy journey. If I ever meet myself, said Zayford, I'll hit myself so hard I won't know what's hit me. Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zayford accusingly, slumped in a corner and switched himself off. On the bridge of the Heart of Gold all was silent. Arthur stared at the rack in front of him and thought. He caught Trillian's eyes as she looked at him inquiringly. He looked back at the rack. Finally he saw it. He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board that lay just in front of the rack. The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I. He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E. Exquisite, he said, on a triple word score. Scores rather a lot, I'm afraid. The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the nth time. Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again. Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he stalked the ship, thumping dead instruments. Why did the ship keep shaking, he thought? Why did it rock and sway? Why could he not find out where they were? Where, basically, were they? The left-hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the universe. In a room halfway up it, Zafod Beeblebrox strode angrily. Rooster sat on the edge of the desk, doing some routine towel maintenance. Hey, where did you say this building was flying to? demanded Zafod. The Frogstar, said Rooster, the most totally evil place in the universe. Do you have food there? said Zafod. Food? You're going to the Frogstar and you're worried about whether they've got food? Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar. Out of the window they could see nothing but the flickering light of the force-beams and vague green streaks, which were presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar fighters. At this speed space itself was invisible and indeed unreal. Here, suck this! said Rooster, offering Zafod his towel. Zafod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his forehead on a small spring. It's soaked in nutrients! explained Rooster. What are you, a messy eater or something? said Zafod. The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones are vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheat germ extract. Zafod took it and looked at it in amazement. What are the brown stains? he asked. Barbecue sauce! said Rooster, for when I get sick of wheat germ. Zafod sniffed it doubtfully. And more doubtfully he sucked a corner. He spat it out again. Eugh! he stated. Yes! said Rooster, when I've had to suck that end I usually need to suck the other end too. Why? said Zafod suspiciously. What's in that? Antidepressants! said Rooster. I've gone right off this towel, you know! said Zafod, handing it back. Rooster took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up. Beeble-brox! he said, sticking his hands behind his head. Give you any idea what's going to happen to you on the Frogstar? They're going to feed me! Hazarded Zafod hopefully. They're going to feed you! said Rooster, into the Total Perspective Vortex. Zafod had never heard of this. He believed that he'd heard of all the fun things in the galaxy, so he assumed that the Total Perspective Vortex was not fun. He asked Rooster what it was. Only, said Rooster, the most savage psychic torture a sentient being can undergo. Zafod nodded a resigned nod. So, he said, no food, eh? Listen, said Rooster urgently. You can kill a man, destroy his body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a man's soul. The treatment lasts seconds, but the effects last the rest of your life. Have you ever had a pan-galactic gargablaster? asked Zafod sharply. This is worse! Wee-ow! admitted Zafod, much impressed. Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me? He added a moment later. They believe it'll be the best way of destroying you forever. They know what you're after. Could they drop me a note and let me know as well? You know, said Rooster, you know, Beeblebrox. You want to meet the man who rules the universe. Any cook, said Zafod. On reflection he added, I doubt if he can. If he could cook a good meal he wouldn't worry about the rest of the universe. I want to meet a cook. Rooster sighed heavily. What are you doing here anyway, demanded Zafod? What's all this got to do with you? I'm just one of those who planned this thing, along with Zarny-Whoop, along with Euden-Vranks, along with your great-grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox. Me? Yes, you. I was told you had changed. I didn't realize how much. But I'm here to do one job. I'll do it before I leave you. What job, man? What are you talking about? I will do it before I leave you. Rooster lapsed into an impenetrable silence. Zafod was terribly glad.
 CHAPTER XI STOMP STOMP WHIRP PLEASED TO BE OF SERVICE. SHUT UP. THANK YOU. STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP WHIRP THANK YOU FOR MAKING A SIMPLE DOOR VERY HAPPY. HOPE YOUR DIODES ROT. THANK YOU. HAVE A NICE DAY. STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP WHIRP IT IS MY PLEASURE TO OPEN FOR YOU. ZARKOV. My satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done. I said, Zarkov, thank you for listening to this message. STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP WHIRP Zephod stopped stomping. He had been stomping around the Heart of Gold for days, and so far no door had said WHIRP to him. He was fairly certain that no door had said WHIRP to him now. It was not the sort of thing that doors said, too concise. Furthermore, there were not enough doors. It sounded as if a hundred thousand people had said WHOOP, which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship. It was dark. Most of the ship's non-essential systems were closed down. It was drifting idly in a remote area of the galaxy, deep in the inky blackness of space. So which particular hundred thousand people would turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected WHOOP? He looked about him, up the corridor and down the corridor. It was all in deep shadow. There were just the very dim pinkish outlines to the doors, which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke, though he tried every way he could think of of stopping them. The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each other, because neither of them was currently a particularly engaging sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking into his soul. It had indeed been an error. It had been late one night. Of course. It had been a difficult day. Of course. There had been soulful music playing on the ship's sound system. Of course. And he had, of course, been slightly drunk. In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of soul-searching had applied, but it had nevertheless clearly been an error. Standing now silent and alone in the dark corridor, he remembered the moment and shivered. His one head looked one way and his other the other, and each decided that the other was the way to go. He listened but could hear nothing. All there had been was the WHOOP. It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of people just to say one word. He started nervously to edge his way in the direction of the bridge. There at least he would feel in control. He stopped again. The way he was feeling, he didn't think he was an awfully good person to be in control. The first shock of that moment, thinking back, had been discovering that he actually had a soul. In fact, it was more or less assumed that he had one, as he had a full complement of everything else, and indeed two of some things, but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep within him had given him a severe jolt, and then to discover—this was the second shock—that it wasn't the totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a natural right to expect, had jolted him again. Then he had thought about what his position actually was, and the renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it. He then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right. "'Freedom!' he said aloud. Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom. "'I can't cope with it,' he said darkly, and sent a third drink down to see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition of the first. He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right. He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together they would get the second to pull itself together. Then all three would go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to, and maybe a bit of a sing as well. He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully, and a sixth for moral support. "'You're drinking too much,' said Trillian. His heads collided, trying to sort out the four of her he could now see into a whole person. He gave up and looked at the navigation screen, and was astonished to see a quite phenomenal number of stars. "'Excitement and adventure and really wild things,' he muttered. "'Look,' she said in a sympathetic tone of voice, and sat down near him. "'It's quite understandable that you're going to feel a little aimless for a bit.' He boggled at her. "'Never seen anyone sit down on their own lap before.' "'Wow!' he said. He had another drink. "'You've finished the mission you've been on for years.' "'I haven't been on it. I've been trying to avoid being on it.' "'You've still finished it,' he grunted. "'There's going to be a terrific party going on in the stomach.' "'I think you've finished me,' he said. "'Here I am, Zephod Beeblebrox. I can go anywhere, do anything. I have the greatest ship in the known sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty well.' "'Are they?' "'As far as I can tell. I'm not an expert in personal relationships.' Trillian raised her eyebrows. "'I am,' he added, ''one hell of a guy. I can do anything I want, only I just haven't the faintest idea what.' He paused. "'One thing,' he further added, 'has suddenly ceased to lead to another,' in contradiction of which he had another drink, and slid graciously off his chair. Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a little research in the ship's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It had some advice to offer on drunkenness. "'Go to it,' it said, 'and good luck.' It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size of the universe and ways of coping with that. Then she found the entry on Hanweval, an exotic holiday planet in one of the wonders of the galaxy. Hanweval is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra-luxury hotels and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and rain. The chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity against. Little is known of how this came about, because none of the geophysicists, probability statisticians, meteoranalysts, or bizarologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there.' "'Terrific!' thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the great white running-shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky, beneath a hot brilliant sun, towards a brightly coloured sandy spaceport. The ship was clearly causing a sensation on the ground, and Trillian was enjoying herself. She heard Zaphod moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship. "'How are you?' she said over the general intercom. "'Fine,' he said brightly. "'Terribly well.' "'Where are you?' "'In the bathroom.' "'What are you doing?' "'Staying here.' After an hour or two it became plain that he meant it, and the ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway. "'Hey-ho!' said Eddie the Computer. Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple of times, and pushed the intercom switch. "'I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this point.' "'Probably not,' replied Zaphod from wherever he was. "'I think a bit of a physical challenge would help draw you out of yourself.' "'Whatever you think, I think,' said Zaphod. Recreational Impossibilities was a heading which caught Trillian's eye when a short while later she sat down to flip through the guide again, and, as the Heart of Gold rushed at improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup of something undrinkable from the Nutrimatic drinks dispenser, and read about how to fly. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying. "'There is an art,' it says, or rather a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day,' it suggests, and try it. The first part is easy. All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt. That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they're really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard. Clearly, it is the second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties. One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground, because you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you're halfway there, so that you're no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it. It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence, most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport. If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs, or tentacles pseudopodia according to phylum and or personal inclination, or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then, in your astonishment, you will miss the ground completely, and remain bobbing just a few inches above it, in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner. This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. Bob and float, float and bob. Ignore all considerations of your own weight, and simply let yourself waft higher. Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point, because they are unlikely to say anything helpful. They are most likely to say something along the lines of, good God, you can't possibly be flying. It is vitally important not to believe them, or they will suddenly be right. Waft higher and higher. Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops, breathing regularly. Do not wave at anybody. When you have done this a few times, you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve. You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your maneuverability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway. You will also learn about how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly on your first attempt. There are private flying clubs you can join, which help you achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and or explain them at the critical moments. Few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them. Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaford wasn't really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or for walking through mountains, or for trying to get the Brantisvogan civil service to acknowledge a change of address card, which were the other things listed under the heading Recreational Impossibilities. Instead she flew the ship to Olosimana Sinica, a world of ice, snow, mind-hurtling beauty and stunning cold. The trek from the snow plains of Liska to the summit of the ice-crystal pyramids of Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet-skis and a team of Sinica snow-hounds, but the view from the top, a view which takes in the thin glacier fields, the shimmering prism mountains, and the far ethereal dancing ice-lights, is one which first freezes the mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty, and Trillian for one felt that she could do with a bit of having her mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty. They went into a low orbit. There lay the silver-white beauty of Olosimana Sinica beneath them. Zaford stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the other doing crosswords till late into the night. Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a sufficiently high number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to get Zaford talking. She prepared, by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen's synthematics, the most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive—delicately oiled meats, scented fruits, fragrant cheeses, fine Aldebaran wines. She carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking things through. "'Zarkov,' said Zaford." Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an even higher number, tossed the tray lightly aside, walked to the transport room, and just teleported herself the hell out of his life. She didn't even program any coordinates. She hadn't the faintest idea where she was going. She just went, a random row of dots flowing through the universe. "'Anything,' she said to herself as she left, "'is better than this.'" "'Good job, too,' muttered Zaford to himself, turned over, and failed to go to sleep. The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship, pretending not to look for her, though he knew she wasn't there. He ignored the computer's querulous demands to know just what the hell was going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag across a pair of its terminals. After a while he began to turn down the lights. There was nothing to see. Nothing was about to happen. Lying in bed one night, and night was now virtually continuous on the ship, he decided to pull himself together, to get things into some kind of perspective. He sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on. He decided that there must be someone in the universe feeling more wretched, miserable, and forsaken than himself, and he determined to set out and find him. Near to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, and he returned to bed. It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped disconsolately about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he heard the, "'Whoop!' said, and it made him very nervous. He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis. He laid his fingertips against the wall and felt an unusual vibration, and now he could quite clearly hear slight noises, and could hear where they were coming from. They were coming from the bridge.' Moving his hand along the wall he came across something he was glad to find. He moved on a little further, quietly. "'Computer,' he hissed. "'Hm?' said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly. "'Is there someone on the ship?' "'Hm,' said the computer. "'Who is it?' "'Hm, hm, hm, hm,' said the computer. "'What?' "'Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm!' Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands. "'Oh, Zor-Kon!' he muttered to himself. Then he stared up the corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance, from which more and purposeful noises were coming, and in which the gagged terminals were situated. "'Computer,' he hissed again. "'Hm?' "'When I un-gag you—' "'Hm?' "'Remind me to punch myself in the mouth. "'Hm, hm!' "'Either one. Now just tell me this. One for yes, two for no. Is it dangerous?' "'Hm.' "'It is?' "'Hm.' "'You didn't just go, hm, twice?' "'Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, You didn't go, hm, twice? "'Hm! HM! "'Mm!' "'Hm!' He inched his way up the corridor, as if he would rather be yarding his way down it, which was true. He was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he suddenly realised to his horror that it was going to be nice to him, and he stopped, dead, he hadn't been able to turn off the door's courtesy voice-circuits. This doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to curve round, and he had been hoping to enter unobserved. He leant despondently back against the wall again, and said some words which his other head was quite shocked to hear. He peered at the dim pink outline of the door, and discovered that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the sensor-field which extended out into the corridor, and told the door when there was someone there for whom it must open, and to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark. He pressed himself hard back against the wall, and edged himself towards the door, flattening his chest as much as he possibly could to avoid brushing against the very, very dim perimeter of the field. He held his breath, and congratulated himself on having lain in bed sulking for the last few days, rather than trying to work out his feelings on chest-expanders in the ship's gym. He then realised he was going to have to speak at this point. He took a series of very shallow breaths, and then said, as quickly and as quietly as he could, Door, if you can hear me, say so very, very quietly. Very, very quietly the door murmured. I can hear you. Good. Now, in a moment I am going to ask you to open. When you open, I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK? OK? And I don't want you to say to me that I have made a simple door very happy, or that it is your pleasure to open for me, and your satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done, OK? OK? And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand? I understand. OK, said Zaphod, tensing himself. Open now. The door stood open quietly. Zaphod slipped quietly through. The door closed quietly behind him. Is that the way you like it, Mr Babelbrox? said the door out loud. I want you to imagine, said Zaphod to the group of white robots who swung around to stare at him at that point, that I have an extremely powerful kilo-zap blaster pistol in my hand. There was an immensely cold and savage silence. The robots regarded him with hideously dead eyes. They stood very still. There was something intensely macabre about their appearance, especially to Zaphod, who had never seen one before or ever known anything about them. The Krekket Wars belonged to the ancient past of the galaxy, and Zaphod had spent most of his early history lessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cyber cubicle next to him, and since his teaching computer had been an integral part of this plot, it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely different set of ideas, which had then resulted in it being scrapped and sent to a home for degenerate cyber-mats, whether it was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine, with the result a. that Zaphod never got near her, and b. that he missed out on a period of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him at this moment. He stared at them in shock. It was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil. From their hideously dead eyes to their powerful, lifeless feet, they were clearly the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to kill. Zaphod gulped in cold fear. They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had forced a passage through some of the vital innards of the ship. Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and worse sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very heart of the ship, the heart of the improbability drive that had been so mysteriously created out of thin air, the heart of gold itself. The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a way as to suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his body, mind, and capability. And when it spoke, what it said seemed to bear this impression out. Before going on to what it actually said, it's worth recording at this point, that Zaphod was the first living, organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over ten billion years. If he had paid more attention to his ancient history lessons, and less to his organic being, he might have been more impressed by this honour. The robot's voice was like its body, cold, sleek, and lifeless. It had almost a cultured rasp to it. It sounded as ancient as it was. It said, You do have a KiloZap blaster pistol in your hand. Zaphod didn't know what it meant for a moment, but then he glanced down at his own hand, and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to a wall bracket was indeed what he had thought it was. Yeah, he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which was quite tricky. Well, I wouldn't want you to overtax your imagination, robot. For a while, nobody said anything, and Zaphod realised that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation, and that it was up to him. I can't help noticing that you have parked your ship, he said with a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction, through mine. There was no denying this. Without regard for any kind of proper dimensional behaviour, they had simply materialised their ship precisely where they wanted it to be, which meant that it was simply locked through the heart of gold as if they were nothing more than two combs. Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if the conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of questions. Haven't you? he added. Yes, replied the robot. Uh, okay, said Zaphod. So, uh, what are you cats doing here? Silence. Uh, robots, said Zaphod. What are you robots doing here? We have come, rasped the robot, for the gold of the bale. Zaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration. The robot seemed to understand this. The gold bale is part of the key we seek, continued the robot, to release our masters from Cricket. Zaphod nodded again. He waggled his gun again. The key, continued the robot simply, was disintegrated in time and space. The golden bale is embedded in the device which drives your ship. It will be reconstituted in the key. Our masters shall be released. The universal readjustment will continue. Zaphod nodded again. Uh, what are you talking about? he said. A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot's totally expressionless face. He seemed to find the conversation depressing. Obliteration, it said. We seek the key, it repeated. We already have the wooden pillar, the steel pillar, and the perspex pillar. In a moment we will have the gold bale. No you won't. We will, stated the robot. No you won't, it makes my ship work. In a moment, repeated the robot patiently, we will have the gold bale. You will not, said Zaphod. And then we must go, said the robot in all seriousness, to a party. Oh, said Zaphod softly, can I come? No, said the robot. We are going to shoot you. Oh yeah, said Zaphod waggling his gun. Yes, said the robot, and they shot him. Zaphod was so surprised they had to shoot him again before he fell down.
 Chapter 5 Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in the known universe. Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny, and more full of wonderfully exciting people than the pomegranates of pips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition of Playbeing magazine headlined an article with the words, When you are tired of Ursa Minor Beta, you are tired of life, the suicide rate there quadrupled overnight. Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta. It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of subtropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close. No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the dominant life-forms of Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their time attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round swimming pools, and inviting investigation officials from the Galactic Geotemporal Control Board to have a nice diurnal anomaly. There is only one city on Ursa Minor Beta, and that is only called a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground there than elsewhere. If you approach Light City by air, and there is no other way of approaching it, no roads, no port facilities, if you don't fly they don't want to see you in Light City, you will see why it has this name. Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering on the swimming pools, shimmering on the white palm-lined boulevards, glistening on the healthy bronzed specks moving up and down them, gleaming off the villas, the hazy air-pads, the beach bars, and so on. Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful building consisting of two thirty-story white towers connected by a bridge half-way up their length. The building is the home of a book, and was built here on the proceeds of an extraordinary copyright lawsuit fought between the book's editors and a breakfast cereal company. The book is a guide-book, a travel-book. It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful books, ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor, more popular than Life Begins at 550, better selling than The Big Bang Theory, a personal view, by Eccentric Golumbitz, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6, and more controversial than Ulan Kulufid's latest blockbusting title, Everything You Never Wanted to Know About Sex, but Have Been Forced to Find Out. And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the outer eastern rim of the galaxy, it has long supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. Although it has many omissions, and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First it is slightly cheaper, and secondly it has the words, Don't Panic, printed in large friendly letters on its cover. It is, of course, that invaluable companion for all those who want to see the marvels of the known universe for less than thirty Altarian dollars a day, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. If you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the Guide offices, assuming you had landed by now and freshened up with a quick dip and shower, then walked east, you would pass along the leafy shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale golden color of the beaches stretching away to your left, astounded by the Mind Surfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves, as if this was nothing special, surprised and eventually slightly irritated by the giant palm trees that hum tuneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in other words, continuously. If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard, you would enter the Lalamatine district of shops, bolo-nut trees, and pavement cafes, where the UM Beatons come to relax after a hard afternoon's relaxation on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those very few areas which don't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon, it enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early Saturday evening. Behind it lie the nightclubs. If on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of evening time, call it what you will, you had approached the second pavement cafe on the right, you would have seen the usual crowd of UM Beatons chatting, drinking, looking very relaxed, and casually glancing at each other's watches to see how expensive they were. You would also have seen a couple of rather disheveled-looking hitch-hikers from Algol, who had recently arrived on an Arcturian mega-freighter, aboard which they had been roughing it for a few days. They were angry and bewildered to discover that here, within sight of the hitch-hiker's guide-building itself, a simple glass of fruit-juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altarian dollars. Sell-out! one of them said bitterly. If at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one, you would have seen Zephod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very startled and confused. The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had been sitting on the bridge of the Starship Heart of Gold. Sell-out! said the voice again. Zephod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two disheveled hitch-hikers at the next table. Where the hell was he? How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand felt the arm of the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in front of him. They seemed solid enough. He sat very still. How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in a place like this? continued the voice. Look at it! Look at it! Zephod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where? And why? He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses. In the same pocket he felt a hard, smooth, unidentified lump of very heavy metal. He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at it in surprise. Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched one of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt much more comfortable with them on. They were a double pair of Jujanta 200 superchromatic peril-sensitive sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger. At the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you. Apart from the scratch, the lenses were clear. He relaxed, but only a little bit. The angry hitchhiker continued to glare at his monstrously expensive fruit juice. Worst thing that ever happened to the guy at moving to Ursa Minor Beta, he grumbled. They've all gone soft. You know, I've even heard that they've created a whole electronically synthesized universe in one of their offices so they can go and research stories during the day and still go to parties in the evening. Not that day and evening mean much in this place. Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zephod. At least he knew where he was now. He assumed that this must be his great-grandfather's doing. But why? Much to his annoyance a thought popped into his mind. It was very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize these thoughts for what they were. His instinct was to resist them. They were the preordained promptings from the dark and locked-off parts of his mind. He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He gave in to it. Ah, what the hell, he thought. Go with the flow. He was too tired, confused, and hungry to resist. He didn't even know what the thought meant.
 Chapter 10 At the third stroke it will be one, thirty-two, and twenty seconds. Beep! Beep! Beep! Fort Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realised that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud a wicked laugh. He switched the incoming signal through from the sub-ethernet to the ship's superb hi-fi system, and the odd rather stilted sing-song voice spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin. At the third stroke it will be one, thirty-two, and thirty seconds. Beep! Beep! Beep! He tweaked the volume up just a little, while keeping a careful eye on a rapidly changing table of figures on the ship's computer display. For the length of time he had in mind, the question of power consumption became significant. He didn't want a murder on his conscience. At the third stroke it will be one, thirty-two, and forty seconds. Beep! Beep! Beep! He checked round the small ship. He walked down the short corridor. At the third stroke he stuck his head into a small functional gleaming steel bathroom. It will be—it sounded fine in there. He looked into the tiny sleeping-quarters. One, thirty-two—it sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of the speakers. He took down the towel. And fifty seconds. Fine. He checked out the packed cargo-hold, and wasn't at all satisfied with the sound. There was altogether too much crated junk in the way. He stepped back out and waited for the door to seal. He broke open a closed control-panel and pushed the jettison button. He didn't know why he hadn't thought of that before. A whooshing, rumbling noise died away quickly into silence. After a pause a slight hiss could be heard again. It stopped. He waited for the green light to show, and then opened the door again, on the now empty cargo-hold. One, thirty-three, and fifty seconds. Very nice. Beep! Beep! Beep! He then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency-suspended animation-chamber, which was where he particularly wanted it to be heard. At the third stroke it will be one, thirty-four, precisely. He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew when, it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it was. Not exactly local time, true, but what the heck! He double-checked the computer-display above the freezer-bed, dimmed the lights, and checked it again. At the third stroke it will be—he tiptoed out and returned to the control-cabin—one, thirty-four, and twenty seconds. The voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone in London, which he wasn't—not by a long way. He gazed out into the inky night. The star the size of a brilliant biscuit-crumb he could see in the distance was Zondestina, or, as it was known in the world from which the rather stilted sing-song voice was being received, Pleiades Zeta. The bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the giant gas-planet Cesiphorus Magna, where the Zaxistian battleships docked, and rising over its horizon was a small cool blue moon, Epon. At the third stroke it will be—for twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and Epon closed. As the ship's computer teased and needed the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity. One, fifty-nine—His original plan had been to close down all external signalling and radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible, unless you were actually looking at it. But then he had an idea he preferred. It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil-thin, broadcasting the incoming time-signal to the planet of the signal's origin, which he would not reach for four hundred years, travelling at light-speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did. Beep! Beep! Beep! He sniggered. He didn't like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled or sniggered, but he had to admit that he had been giggling and sniggering almost continuously for well over half an hour now. At the third stroke the ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit round a little-known and never-visited moon—almost perfect. One thing only remained. He ran again the computer simulation of the launching of the ship's little escapo-buggy, balancing actions, reactions, tangential forces, all the mathematical poetry of motion, and saw that it was good. Before he left he turned out the lights. As his tiny little cigar-tube of an escape-craft zipped out on the beginning of its three-day journey to the orbiting space-station Port Cicero, it rode for a few seconds a long, pencil-thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still. At the third stroke it will be two, thirteen, and fifty seconds. He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud, but he didn't have rum. Beep! Beep! Beep!
 Chapter XXIV Captain? Yes, No. 1. I just had a sort of report thingy from No. 2. Oh, dear! High up on the bridge of the ship the Captain stared out into the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he reclined beneath a wide-domed bubble he could see before and above him the vast panorama of stars through which they were moving, a panorama that had thinned out noticeably during the course of the voyage. Turning and looking backwards over the vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them, which seemed to form almost a solid band. This was the view through the galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had been travelling for years, at a speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he knew it was terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of something or other, or was it three times the speed of something else? Jolly impressive, anyway. He peered into the bright distance behind the ship, looking for something. He did this every few minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn't let it worry him, though. The scientist chaps had been very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly all right, provided nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion. He wasn't panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge. It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated about something. Now what was all that about? A slight cough alerted him to the fact that the ship's first officer was still standing nearby. Nice chap No. 1, not one of the very brightest, had the odd spot of difficulty doing up his shoelaces, but jolly good officer material for all that. The captain wasn't a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoelaces, however long it took him. Not like that ghastly No. 2, strutting about all over the place, polishing his buttons, doing reports every hour. Ship still moving, Captain. Still on course, Captain. Oxygen level still being maintained, Captain. Give it a miss was the captain's vote. Ah yes, that was the thing that had been irritating him. He peered down at No. 1. Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having found some prisoners. The captain thought about this. It seemed pretty unlikely to him, but he wasn't one to stand in his officer's way. Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit, he said. He's always wanted some. He looked at the captain's face and said, I'm not sure I can do it. I'm afraid I can't. I'm afraid I can't. I'm afraid I can't. I'm afraid I can't. I'm afraid I can't. I'm afraid I can't. Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship's apparently endless corridors. No. 2 marched behind them, barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or trying any funny stuff. They seemed to have passed at least a mile of continuous brown Hessian wall weave. Finally they reached a large steel door which slid open when No. 2 shouted at it. They entered. To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable thing about the ship's bridge was not the fifty-foot diameter hemispherical dome which covered it and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down on them. To people who have eaten at the restaurant at the end of the universe, such wonders are commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur, this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated. It confirmed his suspicions that disaster area stunt ship had taken them back at least a million, if not two million, years before their own time. No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath. The bath stood on a six-foot pedestal of rough-hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maxime Galon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave. The taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump. As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that No. 2 approached it. "'Captain, sir!' he shouted through clenched teeth. A difficult trick, but it had years during which to perfect it. A large genial face and a genial foam-covered arm popped up over the rim of the monstrous bath. "'Ah, hello, No. 2,' said Captain, waving a cheery sponge. "'Having a nice day?' No. 2 snapped even further to attention than he already was. "'I have brought you the prisoners I located in Frieza Bay 7, sir!' he yapped. Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion. "'Ah, hello,' they said. The Captain beamed at them. So No. 2 had really found some prisoners. Well, good for him!' thought the Captain. Nice to see a chap doing what he's best at. "'Oh, hello there,' he said. "'Excuse me, not getting up, just having a quick bath. Well, gin and tonics all round, then. Look in the fridge, No. 1.' Certainly, sir." It was a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much importance to attach, that something like eighty-five per cent of all known worlds in the galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called gin and tonics, or gin and tonics, or gin and onyx, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sevolvian chinantomniks, which is ordinary water served at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrokakan chinantoniks, which kills cows at a hundred paces. And in fact, the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds. What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned, it is right off the graph, and yet it persists. Old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about it, and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound importance, and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time, getting very angry with the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their sorrows in whisky and sodas. Number two stood before the captain's bathtub, trembling with frustration. Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners, sir? He squealed. Captain peered at him in bemusement. Why on Golgotha French, should I want to do that? He asked. To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came here! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, said the captain. I expect they just dropped in for a quick gin and tonics, don't you? But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them! Captain looked at them doubtfully. Oh, all right, he said. Well, if you must, ask them what they want to drink. A hard, cold gleam came into number two's eyes. He advanced slowly on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. All right, you scum! he growled. You vermin! he jabbed Ford with a killer zap-gun. Steady on, number two, admonished the captain gently. What do you want to drink? Number two screamed. Well, the gin and tonics sounds very nice to me, said Ford. What about you, Arthur? Arthur blinked. What? Oh, yes, he said. With ice or without? With ice. With ice. What? bellowed number two. Oh, with, please, said Ford. Lemon! Er, yes, please, said Ford. And do you have any of those little biscuits, you know, the cheesy ones? I'm asking the questions! howled number two, his body quaking with apoplectic fury. Er, number two, said the captain softly. Sir! Push off, would you? There's a good chap. I'm trying to have a relaxing bath. Number two's eyes narrowed and became what are known in the shouting and killing people portrayed as cold slits, the idea presumably being to give your opponent the impression that you have lost your glasses, or having difficulty keeping awake. Why this is frightening is an as-yet unresolved problem. He advanced on the Captain, his, no. 2's, mouth a thin hard line. Again, tricky to know why this is understood as frightening behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of trial you were suddenly to come upon the fabled ravenous bug-bladder beast, you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line, rather than as it usually is, a gaping mass of slathering fangs. "'May I remind you, sir,' hissed No. 2 at the Captain, "'that you have now been in that bath for over three years!' This final shot delivered, No. 2 spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to practise darting eye-movements in the mirror. The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame smile. "'Well, you need to relax a lot in a job like mine,' he said. Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur lowered his. Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath pedestal. He patted it. "'Nice,' he lied. He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully he grinned. It was safe. "'Er,' he said to the Captain. "'Yes,' said the Captain. "'I wonder,' said Ford, "'could I ask you actually what your job is, in fact?' A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He spun round. It was the First Officer. "'Your drinks,' he said. "'Oh, thank you,' said Ford. He and Arthur took their chin and tonics. Arthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a whisky and soda. "'I mean, I couldn't help noticing,' said Ford, also taking a sip, "'the bodies in the hold.' "'Bodies?' said the Captain in surprise. Ford paused and thought to himself. Never taking anything for granted, he thought, could it be that the Captain doesn't know he's got fifteen million dead bodies on this ship? The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck. Ford looked round. No. 2 was staring at him in the mirror, but only for an instant. His eyes were constantly on the move. The First Officer was just standing there holding the drinks-tray and smiling benignly. "'Bodies?' said the Captain again. Ford licked his lips. "'Yes,' he said. "'All those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives, you know, down in the hold.' The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and laughed. "'Oh, they're not dead,' he said. "'Good Lord, no. They're frozen. They're going to be revived.' Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked. Arthur seemed to come out of a trance. "'You mean you've got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?' he said. "'Oh, yes,' said the Captain. "'Millions of them. Hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultants, you name it. We're going to colonize another planet.' Ford wobbled very slightly. "'Exciting, isn't it?' said the Captain. "'What with that lot?' said Arthur. "'Ah, no, no, no. Don't misunderstand me,' said the Captain. "'We're just one of the ships in the Ark Fleet. We're the B-Ark, you see. Sorry, could I just ask you to run a little bit more hot water for me?' Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure. "'Thank you so much, my dear fellow. Do help yourself to more drinks, of course.' Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the First Officer's tray, and refilled his glass to the top. "'What,' he said, "'is a B-Ark?' "'This is,' said the Captain, and swished the foamy water around joyfully with the duck. "'Yes,' said Ford. "'But what happened, you see, was,' said the Captain, "'our planet, the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed.' "'Doomed? Oh, yes. So what everyone thought was, let's pack the whole population into some giant space-ships and go and settle on another planet.' Having told this much of his story, he settled back with a satisfied grunt. "'You mean a less doomed one?' prompted Arthur. "'What did you say, dear fellow?' "'A less doomed planet you are going to settle on.' "'Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three ships, you see, three arks in space, and—' "'I'm not boring you, am I?' "'No, no,' said Ford firmly. "'It's fascinating.' "'You know, it's delightful,' reflected the Captain, "'to have someone else to talk to for a change.' No. 2's eyes darted feverishly about the room again, and then settled back on the mirror like a pair of flies briefly distracted from their favourite piece of month-old meat. "'Trouble with a long journey like this,' continued the Captain, "'is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly boring, because half the time you know what you are going to say next.' "'Only half the time?' asked Arthur in surprise. The Captain thought for a moment. "'Yes, about half, I'd say. Anyway, where's the soap?' He fished around and found it. "'Yes, so anyway,' he resumed, "'the idea was that into the first ship, the A ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers, and then into the third, or C ship, would go all the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things, and then into the B ship—that's us—would go everyone else, the middlemen, you see.' He smiled happily at them. "'And we were sent off first,' he concluded, and hummed a little bathing-tune. The little bathing-tune, which had been composed for him by one of the world's most exciting and prolific jingle-writers, who is currently asleep in Hold 36, some nine hundred yards behind them, covered what would otherwise have been an awkward moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and furiously avoided each other's eyes. "'Er,' said Arthur, after a moment, "'what exactly was it that was wrong with your planet, then?' "'Oh, it was doomed, as I said,' said the Captain. "'Apparently it was going to crash into the sun or something, or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us—something of the kind—absolutely terrifying prospect, whatever it was.' "'Oh!' said the First Officer suddenly. "'I thought it was that the planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve-foot piranha-bees. Wasn't that it?' Arthur, too, spun round, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that only comes with the amount of practice he was prepared to put in. "'That's not what I was told,' he hissed. "'My Commanding Officer told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten by an enormous mutant star-goat.' "'Oh, really?' said Ford Prefect. "'Yes. A monstrous creature from the pit of Hell, with siding teeth ten thousand miles long, breath that would boil oceans, claws that would tear continents from their roots, a thousand eyes that burned like the sun, slathering jaws a million miles across, a monster such you see you have never, never, ever—' "'And they made sure that they sent you lot off first, did they?' inquired Arthur. "'Oh, yes,' said the Captain. "'Well, everyone said, very nicely, I thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut and where the phones were clean.' "'Oh, yes,' agreed Ford. "'I can see that would be very important. And the other ships—er—they followed on after you, did they?' For a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in his bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic centre. He squinted into the inconceivable distance. "'Ah, well, it's funny you should say that,' he said, and allowed himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "'because, curiously enough, we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago. But they must be behind us somewhere.' He peered off into the distance again. Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown. "'Unless, of course,' he said softly, "'they were eaten by the goat.' "'Ah, yes,' said the Captain, with a slight hesitancy creeping into his voice. The goat.' His eyes passed over the solid shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge. They winked away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars, but none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and second officers, but they seemed also lost in their own thoughts for a moment. He glanced at Ford Prefect, who raised his eyebrows at him. "'It's a funny thing, you know,' said the Captain at last. "'But now that I've actually come to tell the story to someone else, I mean, does it strike you as odd, No. 1?' "'Er,' said No. 1. "'Well,' said Ford, "'I can see that you've got a lot of things you're going to want to talk about. So thanks for the drink, and if you could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet.' "'Ah, well, that's a little difficult, you see,' said the Captain, "'because our trajectory thingy was pre-set before we left Golga Frencham. I think partly because I'm not very good with figures.' "'You mean we're stuck here on this ship?' exclaimed Ford, suddenly losing patience with the whole charade. "'When are you meant to be reaching this planet you're meant to be colonising?' "'Oh, we're nearly there, I think,' said the Captain. "'Any second now. It's probably time I was getting out of the bath, in fact. Oh, I don't know, though. Why stop just when I'm enjoying it.' "'So we're actually going to land in a minute?' said Arthur. "'Well, not so much land, in fact. Not actually land as such. No, er----' "'What are you talking about?' asked Ford sharply. "'Well,' said the Captain, picking his way through the words carefully, "'I think as far as I remember we were programmed to crash on it.' "'Crash!' shouted Ford and Arthur. "'Yes,' said the Captain, "'yes, it's all part of the plan, I think. There was a terribly good reason for it which I can't quite remember at the moment. It was something to do with, er----' Ford exploded. "'You're a load of useless bloody loonies!' he shouted. "'Ah, yes, that was it!' beamed the Captain. "'That was the reason!'
 XXII. The night in Islington was sweet and fragrant. There were, of course, no fool-honest fire-dragons about in the alley, but if any had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off across the road for a pizza, for they were not going to be needed. Had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle of their American Hots with extra anchovy, they could always have sent across a message to put diastrates on the stereo, which is now known to have much the same effect. No," said Fenchurch, not yet. Arthur put diastrates on the stereo. Fenchurch pushed ajar the upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet, fragrant night air. They both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions, very close to the open bottle of champagne. No, said Fenchurch, not till you found out what's wrong with me, which bit. But I suppose, she added very, very quietly, that we may as well start where your hand is now. Arthur said, So which way do I go? Down, said Fenchurch, on this occasion. He moved his hand. Down, she said, is in fact the other way. Oh, yes. Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schechter custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer, which is not strictly relevant at this point, since the record hadn't yet got to that bit, but there'll be too much else going on when it does, and furthermore the Chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track-list and a stop-watch, so it seems best to mention it now, while things are still moving slowly. And so we come, said Arthur, to your knee. There is something terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee. My left knee, said Fenchurch, is absolutely fine. So it is, said Arthur. Did you know that— What? Um, it's all right. I can tell you do. No, keep going. So it has to be something to do with your feet? She smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders noncommittally against the cushions. Since there are cushions in the universe—on Squanchella's beta, to be exact, two worlds in from the swampland of the mattresses—that actively enjoy being wriggled against, particularly if it's noncommittally because of the syncopated way in which the shoulders move, it's a pity they weren't there. They weren't, but such is life. Arthur held her left foot in his lap, and looked it over carefully. All kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point. I have to admit, he said, that I really don't know what I'm looking for. You'll know when you find it, she said. Really you will. There was a slight catch in her voice. It's not that one. Feeling increasingly puzzled, Arthur let her left foot down onto the floor, and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot. She moved forward, put her arms round and kissed him, because the record had got to that bit which, if you knew the record, you would know made it impossible not to do this. She gave him her right foot. He stroked it, ran his fingers round her ankle, under her toes, along her instep. Could find nothing wrong with it. She watched him with great amusement, laughed, and shook her head. No, don't stop, she said. But it's not that one now. Arthur stopped, and frowned at her left foot on the floor. Don't stop. He stroked her right foot, ran his fingers round her ankle, under her toes, along her instep, and said, You mean it's something to do with which leg I'm holding? She did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy into the life of a simple cushion from Squanchella's beater. He frowned. Pick me up, she said quietly. He let her right foot down to the floor and stood up. So did she. He picked her up in his arms and they kissed again. This went on for a while, and then she said, Now put me down again. Still puzzled, he did so. Well? She looked at him almost challengingly. So what's wrong with my feet? she said. Arthur still did not understand. He sat on the floor, then got down on his hands and knees to look at her feet, insitu as it were, in their normal habitat. And as he looked closely something odd struck him. He put his head right down to the ground and peered. There was a long pause. He sat back heavily. Yes, he said. I see what's wrong with your feet. They don't touch the ground. So, she said, what do you think? Arthur looked up quickly and saw the deep apprehension making her eyes suddenly dark. She bit her lip and was trembling. What do, she stammered, are you? She shook the hair forward over her eyes that were filling with dark fearful tears. He stood up quickly, put his arms around her and gave her a single glance. Perhaps you can do what I can do, he said, and walked straight out of her upstairs front door. The record got to the good bit.
 CHAPTER XIX. Ford Prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gun-fire. He slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway, which he had fashioned into a bunk for himself, by disabling some of the noisier machinery in its vicinity, and padding it with towels. He slung himself down the access ladder, and prowled the corridors moodily. They were claustrophobic and ill-lit, and what light there was was continually flickering and dimming, as power surged this way and that through the ship, causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming noises. That wasn't it, though. He paused and leaned back against the wall as something that looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty searing screech. That wasn't it either. He clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door, and found himself in a larger corridor, though still ill-lit. The ship lurched. It had been doing this a fair bit, but this was more severe. A small platoon of robots went by, making a terrible clattering. Still not it, though. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor, so he walked along it in the other direction. He passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched perspex. One of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure, ranting and raving about the single transferable vote system. It was hard to tell whether he was for it or against it, but he clearly felt very strongly about it. Ford turned the sound down. That wasn't it, though. He passed another monitor. It was showing a commercial for some brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you used it. There was some nasty blaring music with it, too, but that wasn't it. He came upon another, much larger, three-dimensional screen that was monitoring the outside of this vast silver Xaxixian ship. As he watched a thousand horribly weaponed Zursla robot star cruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon, silhouetted against the blinding disk of the star Xaxix, and the ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them. That was it. Ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes. He slumped on the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been burning earlier on, but had now cooled down enough to sit on. He yawned and dug his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy out of his satchel. He activated the screen and flicked idly through some Level 3 entries and some Level 4 entries. He was looking for some good insomnia cures. He found rest, which was what he reckoned he needed. He found rest and recuperation, and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea. He looked up at the monitor screen. The battle was raging more fiercely every second, and the noise was appalling. The ship juddered, screamed, and lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or received. He looked back down at the Guide again, and flipped through a few likely locations. He suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his satchel again. He pulled out a small memory-dump module, wiped off the fluff and biscuit crumbs, and plugged it into an interface on the back of the Guide. When all the information that he could think was relevant had been dumped into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it lightly in the palm of his hand, put the Guide away in his satchel, smirked, and went in search of the ship's computer databanks.
 XXIII The vault was low-ceilinged, dimly lit, and gigantic. At the far end, about three hundred yards away, an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied. Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down to the floor of the vault. "'Wild!' he said. "'What's so great about dead people?' asked Arthur, nervously stepping down after him. "'Don't know,' said Ford. "'Let's find out, shall we?' On a closer inspection, the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi. They stood about waist high, and were constructed of what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly what it was, something that only appeared to be white marble. The tops were semi-translucent, and through them could dimly be perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was they came from far behind them. But beyond that little else could be discerned. Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, oily, white gas, which Arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little atmosphere, until he discovered that it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi, too, were intensely cold to the touch. Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them. He pulled a corner of his towel out of his satchel, and started to rub furiously at something. "'Look, there's a plaque on this one,' he explained to Arthur. "'It's frosted over.'" He rubbed the frost clear, and examined the engraved characters. To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out. But Ford instantly recognised an early form of galactic easy-read. It says, "'Golgafrincham Arkfleet, Ship B, Hold 7, Telephone Sanitiser, Second Class,' and a serial number. "'Telephone sanitiser,' said Arthur. "'A dead telephone sanitiser!' "'Best kind. But what's he doing here?' Ford peered through the top at the figure within. "'Not a lot,' he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his which always make people think he had been overdoing things recently and should try and get some rest. He scampered over to another sarcophagus, a moment's brisk towel-work, and he announced, "'This one's a dead hairdresser. Whoopee!' The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an advertising account executive. The one after that contained a second-hand car salesman, third class. An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford's attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelop him. A thought occurred to Arthur. "'If these are just coffins,' he said, "'why are they kept so cold?' "'Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway?' said Ford, tugging the hatchway open. "'The gas poured down through it. Why, in fact, is anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand dead bodies through space?' "'Ten thousand,' said Arthur, pointing at the archway through which the next chamber was dimly visible. Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up again. "'Fifteen thousand,' he said. "'There's another lot down there.' "'Fifteen million,' said a voice. "'That's a lot,' said Ford. "'A lot, a lot. "'Turn round slowly,' barked the voice, "'and put your hands up. Any other move and I'll blast you into tiny, tiny bits.' "'Hello?' said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and not making any other move. "'Why,' said Arthur, "'isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?' Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His displeasure was communicated partly by the barking, hectoring quality of his voice, and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long, silver, killer-zap gun at them. The designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "'Make it evil,' he had been told. "'Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sorts of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it, then so be it. This is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand. It is a gun for going out and making people miserable with.' Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily. The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them. As he came into the light they could see his gold and black uniform, on which the buttons were so highly polished that they shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash his lights in annoyance. He gestured at the door. "'Out!' he said. People who can supply that amount of firepower don't need to supply verbs as well.' Ford and Arthur went out, closely followed by the wrong end of the killer-zap gun and the buttons. Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion. "'Move!' screamed their captor. Arthur moved. Ford shrugged and moved. In the vault the joggers went to twenty-four empty sarcophagi along the side wall, opened them, climbed in and fell into twenty-four dreamless sleeps.
 Chapter 17. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that disaster area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakaka mine zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concertgoers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship, which stays in orbit around the planet, or, more frequently, around a completely different planet. Their songs are on the whole very simple, and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason. Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties. This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research accountant has recently been appointed Professor of Neo-Mathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his general and his special theories of disaster area tax returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent. Ford staggered back to the table where Zaphod, Arthur and Trillian were sitting, waiting for the fun to begin. "'Gotta have some food,' said Ford. "'Hi, Ford,' said Zaphod. "'You speak to the big noise, boy?' Ford waggled his head noncommittally. "'Hot Black, I sort of spoke to him, yeah.' "'What did he say?' "'Well, not a lot, really. He's a—' "'He's a—he's spending a year dead for tax reasons. I've got to sit down.' He sat down. The waiter approached. "'Oh, would you like to see the menu?' he said. "'Or would you like to meet the dish of the day?' "'Huh?' said Ford. "'Huh?' said Arthur. "'Huh?' said Trillian. "'Oh, that's cool,' said Zaphod. "'We'll meet the meat.'' In a small room in one of the arms of the restaurant complex a tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain, and Oblivion looked him in the face. It was not a pretty face, perhaps because Oblivion had looked him in it so many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too sunken and hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently polished bay window. The hands that held the curtain were long and thin too. They were also cold. They lay lightly along the folds of the curtain, and gave the impression that if he didn't watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner. He let the curtain drop, and the terrible light that played on his features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's praying, finally settling in a rickety chair by a trestle table, where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes. A bell rang. He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His hands brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow-coloured sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone through the door. In the restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace, a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that led up to the centre of the stage. Up the stairs bounded a tall, brilliantly coloured figure. He burst on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone, removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long, thin hand, and stood for a moment bowing left and right to the audience, acknowledging their applause and splaying to them his bay window. He waved to his particular friends in the audience, even though there weren't any there, and waited for the applause to die down. He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely from ear to ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere confines of his face. "'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,' he cried. "'Thank you very much. Thank you so very much.' He eyed them with a twinkling eye. "'Ladies and gentlemen,' he said, ''the universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So welcome one and all to Millie Way's, the restaurant at the end of the universe!' With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous applause. With another gesture he cut it. "'I am your host for tonight,' he said. "'My name is Max Quaddlepleen!' Everybody knew this. His act was famous throughout the known galaxy, but he said it for the fresh applause it generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and wave. "'And I've just come straight from the very, very other end of time where I've been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar, where I can tell you we had a very exciting evening, ladies and gentlemen, and I will be with you right through this historic occasion, the end of history itself!' Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed down further. On every table candles ignited themselves spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners, and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million intimate shadows. A tremor of excitement thrilled through the darkened restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very, very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade. Max's voice was hushed as he continued. "'So, ladies and gentlemen,' he breathed, the candles alight, the band plays softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung with the ancient light of livid, swollen stars, I can see we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!' Even the soft tootling of the band faded away. A stunned shock descended on all those who had not seen this sight before. A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them, a hideous light, a boiling, pestilential light, a light that would have disfigured Hell. The universe was coming to an end. For a few interminable seconds the restaurant spun silently through the raging void. Then Max spoke again. "'For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the tunnel,' he said, "'this is it!' The band struck up again. "'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,' cried Max. "'I'll be back with you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I'll leave you in the very capable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his cataclysmic combo. Big hand, ladies and gentlemen, for Reg and the boys!' The baleful turmoil of the skies continued. Hesitantly the audience began to clap, and after a moment or so normal conversation resumed. Max began his round of the table, swapping strokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living. A large dairy animal approached Zephod Beeblebrox's table. A large, fat, meaty quadruped of the bovine type, with large, watery eyes, small horns, and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips. "'Good evening,' it lowed, and sat back heavily on its haunches. "'I am the main dish of the day. May I interest you in parts of my body?' It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position, and gazed peacefully at them. Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect, and naked hunger from Zephod Beeblebrox. "'Something off the shoulder, perhaps?' suggested the animal, braised in a white wine-sauce. "'Your shoulder?' said Arthur, in a horrified whisper. "'But naturally my shoulder, sir,' mooed the animal contentedly. "'Nobody else is his mind to offer.' Zephod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animal's shoulder appreciatively. "'Or the rump is very good,' murmured the animal. "'I've been exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there's a lot of good meat there.' It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again, and started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again. "'Or a casserole of me, perhaps,' it added. "'You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?' whispered Trillian to Ford. "'Me?' said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes. "'I don't mean anything.' "'That's absolutely horrible!' exclaimed Arthur. "'That's the most revolting thing I've ever heard.' "'What's the problem, earthman?' said Zephod, now transferring his attention to the animal's enormous rump. "'I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing there inviting me to,' said Arthur. "'It's heartless.' "'Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten,' said Zephod. "'That's not the point,' Arthur protested. Then he thought about it for a moment. "'Right,' he said, "'maybe it is the point. I don't care. I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just—' The universe raged about him in its death-throws. "'I think I'll just have a green salad,' he muttered. "'May I urge you to consider my liver?' asked the animal. "'It must be very rich and tender by now. I've been force-feeding myself for months.' "'A green salad!' said Arthur emphatically. "'A green salad!' said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur. "'Are you going to tell me,' said Arthur, "'that I shouldn't have a green salad?' "'Well,' said the animal, "'I know many vegetables that are very clear on that point, which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten, and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. "'And here I am!' It managed a very slight bow. "'Glass of water, please,' said Arthur. "'Look,' said Seyford, "'we want to eat. We don't want to make a meal of the issues. Four rare steaks, please, and hurry. We haven't eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years!' The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle. "'A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so.' "'Very good,' it said. "'I'll just nip off and shoot myself.' He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. "'Don't worry, sir,' he said. "'I'll be very humane.' It waddled unhurriedly off to the kitchen. A matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge steaming steaks. Seyford and Ford wolfed straight into them without a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and started into hers. Arthur stared at his, feeling slightly ill. "'Hey, Earthman,' said Seyford, with a malicious grin on the face that wasn't stuffing itself, "'what's eating you?' And the band played on. All around the restaurant people and things relaxed and shattered. The air was filled with talk of this and that, and with the mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and insidious wines. For an infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax. Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish. "'And now, ladies and gentlemen,' he beamed, "'is everyone having one last wonderful time?' "'Yes,' called out the sort of people who called out yes when comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time. "'That's wonderful,' enthused Max. "'Absolutely wonderful. And as the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing to tear apart the last of the red-hot suns, I know you're all going to want to settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will all find an immensely exciting and terminal experience.' He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye. "'Believe me, ladies and gentlemen,' he said, "'there is nothing penultimate about this one.' He paused again. Despite his timing was immaculate, time after time he had done the show, night after night — not that the word night had any meaning here at the extremity of time — all there was was the endless repetition of the final moment, as the restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of time's furthest edge, and back again. This night was good, though. The audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand. His voice dropped. They had to strain to hear him. This, he said, really is the absolute end, the final chilling desolation in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes extinct. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the proverbial IT.' He dropped his voice to lower, and the stillness of fly would not have dared clear its throat. After this, he said, there is nothing, void, emptiness, oblivion, absolute, nothing. His eyes glittered again, or did they twinkle? Nothing, except, of course, for the sweet trolley and a fine selection of Aldebaran liqueurs. The band gave him a musical sting. He wished they wouldn't. He didn't need it. Not an artist of his calibre. He could play the audience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with relief. He followed on. And for once, he cried cheerily, you don't have to worry about having a hangover in the morning, because there won't be any more mornings. He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up at the sky, going through the same death routine every night. But his glance was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it to do its job, as one professional trusts another. Now, he said strutting about the stage, at the risk of putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties. He pulled a card from his pocket. Do we have, he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, do we have a party here from the Zansalquasier Flammerian Bridge Club from beyond the vault void of Cran? Are they here? A routine cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear. He peered around, trying to find them. Are they here? He asked again, to elicit a louder cheer. He got it, as he always did. Ah, there they are! Well, last bids, lads, and no cheating. Remember, this is a very solemn moment. He lapped up the laughter. And do we also have, do we have a party of minor deities from the halls of Asgard? Away to his right came a rumble of thunder. Lightning arced across the stage. A small group of hairy men with helmets sat looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to him. Has-beens, he thought to himself. Careful with that hammer, sir, he said. They did their trick with the lightning again. Max gave them a very thin-lipped smile. And thirdly, he said, thirdly a party of young conservatives from Sirius B. Are they here? A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at each other and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped and barked unintelligibly. Yes, said Max, well, this is all your fault, you realise that? And finally, said Max, quietening the audience down and putting on his solemn face, finally I believe we have with us here tonight a party of believers, very devout believers, from the church of the second coming of the great prophet Zarkwan. There were about twenty of them sitting right out on the edge of the floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously, and staying apart from the festivities. They blinked resentfully as the spotlight was turned on them. There they are, said Max, sitting there patiently. He said he'd come again and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's hope he's hurrying, fellas, because he's only got eight minutes left. The party of Zarkwan's followers sat rigid, but refusing to be buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them. Max restrained his audience. No, but seriously though, folks, seriously though, no offence meant, no, I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs, so I think a big hand please for the great prophet Zarkwan. The audience clapped respectfully. Wherever he's got to! He blew a kiss to the stony-faced party and returned to the centre of the stage. He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it. It's marvellous though, he rattled on, to see so many of you here tonight, no isn't it though, yes absolutely marvellous, because I know that so many of you come here time and time again, which I think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final end of everything and then return home to your own eras and raise families, strive for new and better societies, fight terrible wars for it, you know to be right, it really gives one hope for the future of all life kind. Except of course, he waved at the blitzing turmoil above and around him, that we know it hasn't got one! Arthur turned to Ford. He hadn't quite got this place worked out in his mind. Look, surely, he said, if the universe is about to end, don't we go with it? Ford gave him a three-pan galactic gargle-blaster look, in other words a rather unsteady one. No, he said, look, he said, as soon as you come into this dive you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal warp thing, I think. Oh, said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak. Look, said Ford, I'll show you. He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with it. Look, he said, imagine this napkin, right, as the temporal universe, right, and this spoon as a transductional mode in the matter-curve. It took him a while to say this last part, and Arthur hated to interrupt him. That's the spoon I was eating with, he said. Right, said Ford, imagine this spoon. He found a small wooden spoon on a tray of relishes. This spoon, but found it rather tricky to pick up. No better still, this fork. Hey, would you let go of my fork, snapped Seyford. Right, said Ford. All right, all right, why don't we say, why don't we say that this wineglass is the temporal universe, what, the one you just knocked on the floor? Did I do that? Yes. All right, said Ford, forget that. I mean, I mean, look, do you, do you know how the universe actually began for a kickoff? Probably not, said Arthur, who wish he'd never embarked on any of this. All right, said Ford, imagine this, right, you get this bath, right, large round bath, and it's made of ebony. Where from, said Arthur, Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons. Doesn't matter. Well, so you keep saying, listen. All right, you get this bath, see, imagine you've got this bath and it's ebony and it's conical. Conical, said Arthur, what sort of, said Ford, it's conical. So what you do is, you see, you fill it with fine white sand, right, or sugar, fine white sand and, or sugar, anything, doesn't matter, sugar's fine. And when it's full, you pull the plug out. Are you listening? I'm listening. You pull the plug out and it all just twirls away, twirls away, you see, out of the plug hole. I see. You don't see, you don't see at all. I haven't got the clever bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit? Tell me the clever bit. I'll tell you the clever bit. Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit was. The clever bit, he said, is this. You film it happening. Clever, agreed Arthur. You get a movie camera and you film it happening. Clever. That's not the clever bit. This is the clever bit. I remember now that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then thread the film in the projector backwards. Backwards. Yes, threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So then you just sit and watch it and everything just appears to spiral upwards out of the plug hole and fill the bath. See? And that's how the universe began, is it, said Arthur. No, said Ford, but it's a marvellous way to relax. He reached for his wine glass. Where's my wine glass? He said. It's on the floor. Ah. Tipping back his chair to look for it, Ford collided with the small green waiter who was approaching a table carrying a portable telephone. Ford excused himself to the waiter, explaining that it was because he was extremely drunk. The waiter said that was quite all right and that he perfectly understood. Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table. Mr. Zaford at Bibblebrocks, inquired the waiter. Yeah, said Zaford, glancing up from his third stake. There is a phone call for you. Hey, what? A phone call, sir. For me? Here? Hey, but I mean, who knows where I am? One of his minds raced, the other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still shoveling in. Excuse me if I carry on, won't you? said his eating-head, and carried on. There were now so many people after him he had lost count. He shouldn't have made such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not, though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if there's no one watching you have it? Maybe somebody tipped off the Galactic Police, said Trillian. Everyone saw you come in. You mean they want to arrest me over the phone? said Zaford. Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm cornered. Yeah, said a voice from under the table. You go to pieces so fast people get hit by the shrapnel. Hey, what is this, Judgment Day? snapped Zaford. Do we get to see that as well? asked Arthur nervously. I'm in no hurry, muttered Zaford. OK, so who's the cat on the phone? he kicked forward. Hey, get up there, kid, said Tim. I may need you. I am not, said the waiter, personally acquainted with the metal gentleman in question, sir. Metal? Yes, sir. Did you say metal? Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally acquainted with the metal gentleman in question. OK, carry on. But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a considerable number of millennia. It seems that you left here somewhat precipitately. Left here? said Zaford. Are you being strange? We only just arrived here. Indeed, sir, persisted the waiter doggedly. But before you arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here. Zaford tried this in one brain and then in the other. You're saying, he said, that before we arrived here, we left here? This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter. Precisely, sir, he said. Put your analysts on danger money, baby, advised Zaford. Now, wait a minute, said Zaford, emerging above table level again. Where exactly is here? To be absolutely exact, sir, it is the Frogstar World B.
 Prologue. Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small, unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life-forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has, or had, a problem which was this. Most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper which were unhappy. And so the problem remained. Lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they had all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place, and some said that even the trees had been a bad move and that no one should ever have left the oceans. And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small café in Rickmansworth suddenly realised what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, the earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, and so the idea was lost, seemingly for ever. This is her story.
 Chapter 15 Two months later, Zippo Bibbrock, 5 x 10 to the 8th, had cut the bottoms off his Galactic State jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee his judgments commanded, lying on a jewelled beach, having essence of qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of the jury. She was a Sulphinian girl from beyond the cloud-worlds of Yaga. She had skin like lemon-silk, and was very interested in legal bodies. "'Did you hear the news?' she said. "'Weel-ah!' said Zippo Bibbrock, 5 x 10 to the 8th, and you would have had to have been there to know exactly why he said this. None of this was on the tape of informational illusions, and is all based on hearsay.' "'No,' he added, when the thing that had made him say, "'Weel-ah!' had stopped happening. He moved his body round slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of Primeval Vod's Three Suns, which was now creeping over the ludicrously beautiful horizon, and the sky now glittered with some of the greatest tanning-power ever known. A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea, trailed along the beach, and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go next. On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again. It drifted back to sea. "'I hope it isn't good news,' muttered Zippo Bibbrock, 5 x 10 to the 8th, "'cause I don't think I could bear it.' "'Your cricket-judgment was carried out to-day,' said the girl sumptuously. There was no need to say such a straightforward thing sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it anyway, because it was that sort of day. I heard it on the radio,' she said, when I went back to the ship for the oil. "'Aha!' murmured Zippo, and rested his head back on the jewelled sand. "'Something happened,' she said. "'H'm?' "'Just after the slow-time envelope was locked,' she said, and paused a moment from rubbing in the essence of qualactin. A cricket-warship which had been missing, presumed destroyed, turned out to be just missing, after all. It appeared and tried to seize the key.' Zippo sat up sharply. "'Hey, what?' he said. "'It's all right,' she said, in a voice which would have calmed the big bang down. "'Apparently there was a short battle. The key and the warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space-time continuum. Apparently they are lost for ever.' She smiled, and ran a little more essence of qualactin on to her fingertips. He relaxed and lay back down. "'Do what you did a moment or two ago,' he murmured. "'That?' she said. "'No, no, no,' he said. "'That.' She tried again. "'That?' she asked. "'Wee-lah!' Again you had to be there. The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again. A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him.
 Chapter VIII Arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed, overjoyed to be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed at all to discover it was the middle of February. He almost danced to the fridge, found the three least hairy things in it, put them on a plate, and watched them intently for two minutes. Since they made no attempt to move within that time, he called them breakfast and ate them. Between them they killed a virulent space disease he had picked up without knowing it, in the Flagothan gas-swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would have killed off half the population of the Western Hemisphere, blinded the other half, and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile. So the earth was lucky there. He felt strong, he felt healthy. He vigorously cleared away the junk mail with a spade, and then buried the cat. Just as he was finishing that, the phone went, but he let it ring while he maintained a moment's respectful silence. Whoever it was would ring back if it was important. He kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside. There had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of junk. Some documents from the Council, dated three years earlier, relating to the proposed demolition of his house, and some other letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass scheme in the area. There was also an old letter from Greenpeace, the ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made contributions, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity, and some postcards from friends vaguely complaining that he never got in touch these days. He collected these things together and put them in a cardboard file, which he marked, Things to Do. Since he was feeling so vigorous and dynamic that morning, he even added the word Urgent. He unpacked his towel and a few other odd bits and pieces from the plastic bag he had acquired at the Port Brasta Mega-Market. The slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in lingua centauri, which was completely incomprehensible in any other language, and therefore entirely pointless for a duty-free shop at a spaceport. The bag also had a hole in it, so he threw it away. He realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to earth, kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the A.303. He had lost his battered and space-worn copy of the thing which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had traversed. He had lost the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Well, he told himself, this time I really won't be needing it again. He had some calls to make. He had decided how to deal with the massive contradictions his return journey precipitated, which was that he would simply brazen it out. He phoned the BBC and asked to be put through to his department head. Oh, hello. Arthur Dent here. Look, sorry I haven't been in for six months, but I've gone mad. Oh, not to worry, said his department head. Thought it was probably something like that happens here all the time. How soon can we expect you? When do hedgehogs stop hibernating? Sometime in the spring, I think. Well, I'll be in shortly after that. Righty-ho. He flipped through the yellow pages and made a short list of numbers to try. Oh, hello. Is that the Old Elms Hospital? Yes, I was just phoning to see if I could have a word with Fenella. Fenella? Good Lord, silly me. I forget my own name next. Fenella? Isn't this ridiculous? A patient of yours, dark-haired girl, came in last night. I'm afraid we don't have any patients called Fenella. Oh, don't you? I meant Fiona, of course. We just call her Fen. I'm sorry. Goodbye. Click. Six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his mood of vigorous, dynamic optimism, and he decided that before it deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it a little. He had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable weirdness about himself at a stroke, and he whistled to himself as he pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night. Arthur! He grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from all corners of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful time he had had in Southern California.
 Chapter XXXI In a deep well of darkness a crippled robot sat. It had been silent in its metallic darkness for some time. It was cold and damp, but being a robot it was supposed not to be able to notice these things. With an enormous effort of will, however, it did manage to notice them. Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the cricket war-computer. It wasn't enjoying the experience, and neither was the central intelligence of the cricket war-computer. The cricket robots, who had salvaged this pathetic metal creature from the swamps of Squanch-la-Zeta, had done so because they had recognized almost immediately its gigantic intelligence and the use this could be to them. They hadn't reckoned with the attendant personality disorders, which the coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampness, and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease. It was not happy with its task. Apart from anything else, the mere coordination of an entire planet's military strategy was only taking up a tiny part of its formidable mind, and the rest of it had become extremely bored. Having solved all the major mathematical, physical, chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological, and psychological problems of the universe—except his own—three times over, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken up composing short, dolorous ditties of no tone or indeed tune. The latest one was a lullaby. Marvin droned. Now the world has gone to bed. Darkness won't engulf my head. I can see by infrared. How I hate the night! He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle the next verse. Now I lay me down to sleep. Try to count electric sheep. Sweet dream-wishes you can keep. How I hate the night! Marvin! hissed a voice. His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate network of electrodes that connected him to the central cricket-war computer. An inspection-hatch had opened, and one of a pair of unruly heads was peering through, while the other kept on jogging it, by continually darting to look this way and that, extremely nervously. "'Oh, it's you,' muttered the robot. "'I might have known.' "'Hey, kid,' said Zayford in astonishment, "'was that you singing just then?' "'I am,' Marvin acknowledged bitterly, in particularly scintillating form at the moment. Zayford poked his head into the hatchway and looked around. "'Are you alone?' he said. "'Yes,' said Marvin. "'Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only companions, and vast intelligence, of course, and infinite sorrow, and—' "'Yeah,' said Zayford. "'Yeah. What's your connection with all this?' "'This,' said Marvin, indicating with his less-damaged arm all the electrodes that connected him with the cricket-computer. "'Then,' said Zayford awkwardly, "'I guess you must have saved my life—twice!' "'Three times,' said Marvin. Zayford's head snapped round—his other one was looking hawkishly in entirely the wrong direction—just in time to see the lethal killer-robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke. It staggered backward and slumped against a wall. It slid down. It slipped sideways, threw its head back, and started to sob inconsolably. Zayford looked back at Marvin. "'You must have a terrific outlook on life,' he said. "'Just don't even ask,' said Marvin. "'I won't,' said Zayford, and didn't. "'Hey, look,' he added, "'you're doing a terrific job!' "'Which means, I suppose,' said Marvin, and requiring only one ten thousand million billion trillion greenth part of his mental powers to make this particular logical leap, "'that you're not going to release me, or anything like that.' "'Kids, you know I'd love to.' "'But you're not going to.' "'No.' "'I see.' "'You're working well.' "'Yes,' said Marvin. "'Why stop now, just when I'm hating it?' "'I have to go find Trillian and the guys. Hey, you any idea where they are? I mean, I've just got a planet to choose from. Could take a while.' "'They are very close,' said Marvin dolefully. "'You can monitor them from here, if you like.' "'I'd better go get them,' asserted Zayford. "'Maybe they need some help, right?' "'Maybe,' said Marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious voice, "'it would be better if you monitored them from here. "'That young girl,' he added unexpectedly, "'is one of the least benightedly unintelligent organic life-forms. "'It has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting.' "'Zayford took a moment or two to find his way through this labyrinthine "'string of negatives, and emerged at the other end with surprise. "'Trillian?' he said. "'Ah, she's just a kid. Cute, yeah, but temperamental. "'You know how it is with women. "'Or perhaps you don't. I assume you don't. "'If you don't, I don't want to hear about it. Plug us in.' "'Totally manipulated.' "'What?' said Zayford. "'It was Trillian speaking.' "'He turned round. "'The wall against which the cricket-robot was sobbing "'had lit up to reveal a scene taking place "'in some other unknown part of the cricket-robot war-zones. "'It seemed to be a council-chamber of some kind. "'Zayford couldn't make it out too clearly "'because of the robot slumped against the screen. "'He tried to move the robot, "'but it was heavy with its grief, "'and tried to bite him. "'So he just looked round it as best he could.' "'Just think about it,' said Trillian's voice. "'Your history is just a series of freakishly improbable events, "'and I know an improbable event when I see one. "'Your complete isolation from the galaxy was freakish for a start. "'Right out on the very edge with a dust-cloud around you? "'It's a set-up, obviously!' "'Zayford was mad with frustration "'that he couldn't see the screen. "'The robot's head was obscuring his view "'of the people Trillian was talking to. "'Its multifunctional battle-club was obscuring the background, "'and the elbow of the arm it had pressed "'tragically against its brow "'was obscuring Trillian herself. "'Then,' said Trillian, "'the spaceship that crash-landed on your planet. "'That's really likely, isn't it? "'Do you any idea what the odds are against a drifting spaceship "'accidentally intersecting with the orbit of a planet?' "'Hey,' said Zayford, "'she doesn't know what the zark she's talking about. "'I've seen that spaceship. It's a fake. No deal.' "'I thought it might be,' said Marvin from his prison behind Zayford. "'Oh, yeah,' said Zayford, "'it's easy for you to say that. I just told you. "'Anyway, I don't see what it's got to do with anything.' "'And especially,' continued Trillian, "'the odds against it intersecting "'with the orbit of the one planet in the galaxy "'or the whole of the universe, as far as I know, "'that will be totally traumatised to see it. "'You don't know what the odds are, nor do I. "'They're that big. Again, it's a set-up. "'I wouldn't be surprised if that spaceship was just a fake.' "'Zayford managed to move the robot's battle-club. "'Behind it on the screen were the figures of Ford, Arthur, "'and Slarty Bartfast, "'who appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing. "'Hey, look,' said Zayford excitedly. "'The guys are doing great. Rah, rah, rah! "'Go get them, guys!' "'And what about,' said Trillian, "'all this technology you suddenly managed to build for yourselves "'almost overnight? "'Most people would take thousands of years to do all that. "'Someone was feeding you what you needed to know. "'Someone was keeping you at it. "'I know, I know,' she added "'in response to some unseen interruption. "'I know you didn't realise it was going on. "'That is exactly my point. "'You never realised anything at all. "'Like the supernova bomb.' "'How do you know about that?' "'I just know,' said Trillian. "'You expect me to believe that you are bright enough "'to invent something that brilliant "'and would be too dumb to realise it would take you with it as well? "'That's not just stupid. "'That's spectacularly obtuse.' "'Hey, what's this bomb thing?' "'The supernova bomb,' said Marvin. "'It's a very, very small bomb.' "'Yeah?' "'That would destroy the whole thing.' "'It's a very, very small bomb.' "'Yeah?' "'That would destroy the universe completely,' added Marvin. "'Good idea, if you ask me. "'They won't get it to work, though.' "'Why not if it's so brilliant?' "'It's brilliant,' said Marvin. "'They're not. "'They got as far as designing it "'before they were locked in the envelope. "'They've spent the last five years building it. "'They think they've got it right, but they haven't. "'They're as stupid as any other organic life-form. "'I hate them.' Trillian was continuing. "'Say for a moment, "'say for a moment,' Zephyr tried to pull "'the cricket robot away by its leg, "'but it kicked and growled at him, "'and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing. "'Then suddenly it slumped over "'and continued to express its feelings "'out of everybody's way on the floor.' "'Trillian was standing alone "'in the middle of the chamber, "'tired but with fiercely burning eyes. "'Ranged in front of her "'with the pale-faced and wrinkled "'elder masters of cricket, "'motionless behind their widely-curved desk, staring at her with helpless fear and hatred. In front of them, equidistant between their control-desk and the middle of the chamber where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim white pillar, about four feet tall. On top of it stood a small white globe, about three, maybe four inches in diameter. Beside it stood a cricket-robot, with its multifunctional battle-club. "'In fact,' explained Trillian, "'you are so dumb stupid!' She was sweating. Zaphod felt this was an unattractive thing for her to be doing at this point. "'You're all so dumb stupid that I doubt—I very much doubt—if you've been able to build the bomb properly, without any help from Haktar for the last five years!' "'Who's this guy, Haktar?' said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders. If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn't hear him. All his attention was concentrated on the screen. One of the Elders of Cricket made a small motion with his hand toward the cricket-robot. The robot raised its club. "'There's nothing I can do,' said Marvin. "'It's on an independent circuit from the others.' "'Wait!' said Trillian. The Elder made a small motion. The robot halted. Trillian suddenly seemed very doubtful of her own judgment. "'How do you know all this?' said Zaphod to Marvin at this point. "'Computer records,' said Marvin. "'I have access.' "'You're very different, aren't you?' said Trillian to the Elder Masters. "'From your fellow-worldlings down on the ground. You've spent all your lives up here, unprotected by the atmosphere. You've been vulnerable. The rest of your race is very frightened, you know. They don't want you to do this. You're out of touch. Why don't you check up?' The Cricket Elder grew impatient. He made a gesture to the robot that was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it. The robot swung its battle-club. It hit the small white globe. The small white globe was the supernova-bomb. It was a very, very small bomb that was designed to bring the entire universe to an end. The supernova-bomb flew through the air. It hit the back wall of the Council Chamber and dented it very badly. "'So how does she know all this?' said Zaphod. Marvin kept a sullen silence. "'Ah, probably just bluffing,' said Zaphod. "'Poor kid! I should never have left her alone.'
 CHAPTER XVII MISERY DEJECTION MORE MISERY AND MORE DEJECTION He needed a project, and he gave himself one. He would find where his cave had been. On prehistoric earth he had lived in a cave—not a nice cave—a lousy cave, but—there was no but—it had been a totally lousy cave, and he had hated it. But he had lived in it for five years, which made it home of some kind, and a person likes to keep track of his homes. Arthur Dent was such a person, and he went to Exeter to buy a computer. That was what he really wanted, of course, a computer, but he felt he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply went and lashed out a lot of readies on what people might otherwise mistake as being just a thing to play with. So that was his serious purpose, to pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric earth. He explained this to the man in the shop. "'Why?' said the man in the shop. "'This is a tricky one.' "'Okay, skip that,' said the man in the shop. "'How?' "'Well, I was hoping you could help me with that.' The man sighed, and his shoulders dropped. "'Have you much experience of computers?' Arthur wondered whether to mention Eddie, the shipboard computer on the Heart of Gold, who would have done the job in a second, or deep thought, or—but he decided he wouldn't. "'No,' he said. "'Looks like a fun afternoon,' said the man in the shop, but he said it only to himself. Arthur bought the Apple anyway. Over a few days he also acquired some astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night, and worked away busily at it for weeks, cheerfully putting off the conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to, which was that the whole project was completely ludicrous. Rough drawings from memory were futile. He didn't even know how long it had been beyond Ford Prefect's rough guess at the time that it was a couple of million years, and he simply didn't have the maths. Still, in the end he worked out a method which would at least produce a result. He decided not to mind the fact that with the extraordinary jumbles of rules of thumb, wild approximations, and arcane guesswork he was using he'd be lucky to hit the right galaxy. He just went ahead and got a result. He would call it the right result. Who would know? As it happened, through the myriad and unfathomable chances of fate, he got it exactly right, though of course he would never know that. He just went up to London and knocked on the appropriate door. Oh! I thought you were going to phone me first. Arthur gaped in astonishment. You can only come in for a few minutes, said Fenchurch. I'm just going out.
 Chapter 4 It was a charming and delightful day at Lord's, as Ford and Arthur tumbled haphazardly out of a space-time anomaly and hit the immaculate turf rather hard. The applause of the crowd was tremendous. It wasn't for them, but instinctively they bowed anyway, which was fortunate, because this small red heavy ball, which the crowd actually had been applauding, whistled mere millimetres over Arthur's head. In the crowd a man collapsed. They threw themselves back to the ground, which seemed to spin hideously around them. "'What was that?' hissed Arthur. "'Something red,' hissed Ford back at him. "'Where are we?' "'Er, somewhere green.' "'Shapes,' muttered Arthur. "'I need shapes.'" The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of astonishment and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what they had just seen or not. "'This your sofa?' said a voice. "'What was that?' whispered Ford. Arthur looked up. "'Something blue,' he said. "'Shape,' said Ford. Arthur looked again. "'It is shaped,' he hissed at Ford, with his brow savagely furrowed, "'like a policeman.' They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning deeply. The blue thing shaped like a policeman tapped them both on the shoulders. "'Come on, you two,' the Shape said. "'Let's be having it.'" These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur. He leapt to his feet like an author hearing the phone ring, and shot a series of startled glances at the panorama around him, which had suddenly settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness. "'Where did you get this from?' he yelled at the policeman's Shape. "'What did you say?' said the startled Shape. "'This is Lord's Cracky Ground, isn't it?' snapped Arthur. "'Where did you find it? How did you get it here? I think,' he added, clasping his hand to his brow, "'I'd better calm down!' he squatted down abruptly in front of Ford. "'It is a policeman,' he said. "'What do we do?' Ford shrugged. "'What do you want to do?' he said. "'I want you,' said Ford, "'to tell me that I have been dreaming for the last five years.' Ford shrugged again and obliged. "'You've been dreaming for the last five years,' he said. Arthur got to his feet. "'It's all right, officer,' he said. "'I've been dreaming for the last five years. Ask him,' he added, pointed to Ford. He was in it. Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch, brushing down his dressing gown. He then noticed his dressing gown and stopped. He stared at it. He flung himself at the policeman. "'So where did I get these clothes from?' he howled. He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass. Ford shook his head. "'He's had a bad two million years,' he said to the policeman, and together they heaved Arthur onto the sofa and carried him off the pitch, and were only briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of the sofa on the way." Reactions to all this from the crowd were many and various. Most of them couldn't cope with watching it and listen to it on the radio instead. "'Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian,' said one radio commentator to another. "'I don't think there have been any mysterious materialisations on the pitch, oh, since—well, I don't think there have been any at all, have there, that I recall. Edgbaston, 1932? Ah, now what happened then? Well, Peter, I think it was canter-facing Wilcox coming up to Bolton, the pavilion end, when a spectator suddenly ran straight across the pitch. There was a pause whilst the first commentator considered this. "'Yes,' he said, "'yes, there's nothing actually very mysterious about that, is there? He didn't actually materialise, did he, just ran on?' "'No, that's true, but he did claim to have seen something materialise on the pitch.' "'Ah, did he? Yes, an alligator, I think, of some description. Ah, and had anyone else noticed it? Apparently not, and no one was able to get a very detailed description from him, so only the most perfunctory search was made.'" And what happened to the man? Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him some lunch, but he explained that he'd already had a rather good one, so the matter was dropped and Warwickshire went on to win by three wickets. So not very like this current instance. For those of you who just tuned in, you may be interested to know that two men, two rather scruffily attired men, and indeed a sofa, a Chesterfield, I think, yes, a Chesterfield, have just materialised here in the middle of Lord's Cricket Ground, but I don't think they meant any harm, they've been very good-natured about it, and—sorry, can I interrupt you for a moment, Peter, and say that the sofa has just vanished? So it has. Well, that's one mystery less. Still, it's definitely one for the record books, I think, particularly occurring at this dramatic moment in play, England now needing only 24 runs to win the series. The men are leaving the pitch in the company of a police officer, and I think everyone's settling down now and play is about to resume. "'Now, sir,' said the policeman, after they had made a passage through the curious crowd and laid Arthur's peacefully inert body on a blanket. "'Perhaps you'd care to tell me who you are, where you came from, and what that little scene was all about?' Ford looked at the ground for a moment, as if steadying himself for something. Then he straightened up and aimed a look at the policeman, which hit him with the full force of every inch of the six light-years' distance between earth and Ford's home near Beetlejuice. "'All right,' said Ford, very quietly. 'I'll tell you.' "'Yes, well, that won't be necessary,' said the policeman hurriedly. 'Just don't let whatever it was happen again.' The policeman turned round and wandered off in search of anyone who wasn't from Beetlejuice. Fortunately the ground was full of them. Arthur's consciousness approached his body as if from a great distance, and reluctantly. It had had some bad times in there. Slowly, nervously, it entered, and settled down into its accustomed position. Arthur sat up. "'Where am I?' he said. "'Lord's Cricket Ground,' said Ford. "'Fine,' said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again for a quick breather. His body flopped back on the grass. Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face. "'How are you feeling?' said Ford. "'I'm home,' said Arthur, hoarsely. He closed his eyes and greedily inhaled the steam from his tea, as if it was—well, as far as Arthur was concerned, as if it was tea, which it was. "'I'm home,' he repeated. "'Home. It's England. It's—today. The nightmare is over.' He opened his eyes again and smiled serenely. "'I'm where I belong,' he said in an emotional whisper. "'There are two things I feel I should tell you,' said Ford, tossing a copy of The Guardian over the table at him. "'I'm home,' said Arthur. "'Yes,' said Ford. "'One is,' he said, pointing at the date at the top of the paper, "'that the earth will be demolished in two days' time.' "'I'm home,' said Arthur. "'Tea,' he said. "'Cricket,' he added with pleasure. "'Mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer cans.' Slowly he began to focus on the newspaper. He cocked his head on one side with a slight frown. "'I've seen that one before,' he said. His eyes wandered slowly up to the date, which Ford was idly tapping at. His face froze for a second or two, and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which Arctic ice-flows do so spectacularly in the spring. "'And the other thing,' said Ford, "'is that you appear to have a bone in your beard.' He tossed back his tea. Outside the refreshment-tent the sun was shining on a happy crowd. It shone on white hats and red faces. It shone on ice-lollies and melted them. It shone on the tears of small children whose ice-lollies had just melted and fallen off the stick. It shone on the trees. It flashed off whirling cricket-bats. It gleamed off the utterly extraordinary object which was parked behind the sight-screens, and which nobody appeared to have noticed. It beamed on Ford and Arthur as they emerged blinking from the refreshment-tent and surveyed the scene around them. Arthur was shaking. "'Perhaps,' he said, "'I should—' "'No,' said Ford sharply. "'What?' said Arthur. "'Don't try and phone yourself up at home.' "'How did you know?' Ford shrugged. "'But why not?' said Arthur. "'People who talk to themselves on the phone,' said Ford, "'never learn anything to their advantage.' "'But look,' said Ford." He picked up an imaginary phone and dialed an imaginary dial. "'Hello?' he said into the imaginary mouthpiece. "'Is that Arthur Dent?' "'Ah, hello, yes. This is Arthur Dent speaking. Did you hang up?' He looked at the imaginary phone in disappointment. "'He hung up,' he said, shrugged, and put the imaginary phone neatly back on its imaginary hook. "'This is not my first temporal anomaly,' he added. A glummer look replaced the already glum look on Arthur Dent's face. "'So we're not home and dry,' he said. "'We could not even be said,' replied Ford, "'to be home and vigorously towelling ourselves off.' The game continued. The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, a trot, and then a run. He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms and legs, out of which flew a ball. The batsman swung and thwacked it behind him over the sight-screens. Ford's eyes followed the trajectory of the ball and jogged momentarily. He stiffened. He looked along the flight-path of the ball again, and his eyes twitched again. "'This isn't my towel,' said Arthur, who was rummaging in his rabbit-skin bag. "'Shh!' said Ford. He screwed his eyes up in concentration. "'I had a Golgrafrinchen jogging towel,' continued Arthur. "'It was blue with yellow stars on it. This isn't it. "'Shh!' said Ford again. He covered one eye and looked with the other. "'This one's pink,' said Arthur. "'It isn't yours, is it?' "'I would like you to shut up about your towel,' said Ford. "'It isn't my towel,' insisted Arthur. "'That is the point. I'm trying to—' "'And the time at which I would like you to shut up about it,' continued Ford in a low growl, "'is now.'" "'All right,' said Arthur, starting to stuff it back into the primitively-stitched rabbit-skin bag. "'I realise that it is probably not important in the cosmic scale of things. "'It's just odd. That's all. "'A pink towel, suddenly, instead of a blue one with yellow stars.'" Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely. Or rather, not actually beginning to behave strangely, but beginning to behave in a way that was strangely different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved. What he was doing was this. Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow members of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his hands in sharp movements across his face, ducking down behind some people, leaping up behind others, then standing still and blinking a lot. After a moment or two of this, he started to stalk forward slowly and stealthily, wearing a puzzled frown of concentration, like a leopard that is not sure whether it's just seen a half-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty plain. "'This isn't my bag, either,' said Arthur suddenly. Ford's spell of concentration was broken. He turned angrily on Arthur. "'I wasn't talking about my towel,' said Arthur. "'We've established that that isn't mine. "'It's just that the bag into which I was putting the towel, "'which is not mine, is also not mine, though it is extraordinarily similar. "'Now, personally, I think that that is extremely odd, "'especially as the bag was one I'd made myself on prehistoric earth. "'These are also not my stones,' he added, "'pulling a few flat grey stones out of the bag. "'I was making a collection of interesting stones, "'and these are clearly very dull ones.' A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated whatever it was that Ford said in reply to this piece of information. The cricket ball, which had excited this reaction, fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur's mysterious rabbit-skin bag. "'Now, I would say there was also a very curious event,' said Arthur, "'rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on the ground. "'I don't think it's here,' he said to the small boys "'who immediately clustered round him to join in the search. "'It probably rolled off somewhere. "'Over there, I expect.' He pointed vaguely in the direction in which he wished they would push off. One of the boys looked at him quizzically. "'You all right?' said the boy. "'No,' said Arthur. "'Then why have you got bone in your beard?' said the boy. "'I'm training it to like being wherever it's put.' Arthur prided himself on saying this. "'It was,' he thought, "'exactly the sort of thing that would entertain and stimulate young minds.' "'Oh!' said the small boy, putting his head on one side and thinking about it. "'What's your name?' "'Dent,' said Arthur. "'Arthur Dent.' "'You're a jerk, Dent,' said the boy. "'Complete arsehole!' The boy looked past him at something else to show that he wasn't in any particular hurry to run away, and then wandered off scratching his nose. Suddenly Arthur remembered that the earth was going to be demolished again in two days' time, and just this once didn't feel too bad about it. Play resumed with a new ball. The sun continued to shine, and Ford continued to jump up and down, shaking his head and blinking. "'Something's on your mind, isn't it?' said Arthur. "'I think,' said Ford, in a tone of voice which Arthur now recognised as one which presaged something utterly unintelligible, "'that there's an S.E.P. over there.' He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not the one in which he was looking. Arthur looked in the one direction, which was toward the sight-screens, and in the other, which was at the field of play. He nodded. He shrugged. He shrugged again. "'A what?' he said. "'An S.E.P.' "'An S. what?' "'E.P.' "'And what's that?' "'Somebody else's problem,' said Ford. "'Ah, good,' said Arthur, and relaxed. He had no idea what that was all about, but at least it seemed to be over. It wasn't. "'Over there,' said Ford, again pointing at the sight-screens and looking at the pitch. "'Where?' said Arthur. "'There,' said Ford. "'I see,' said Arthur. Who didn't? "'You do,' said Ford. "'What?' said Arthur. "'Can you see,' said Ford patiently, "'the S.E.P.' "'I thought you said that was someone else's problem.' "'That's right.' Arthur nodded slowly, carefully, and with an air of immense stupidity. "'And I want to know,' said Ford, "'if you can see it.' "'You do?' "'Yes.' "'What,' said Arthur, "'does it look like?' "'Well, how should I know, you fool?' shouted Ford. "'If you can see it, you tell me.' Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples, which was the hallmark of so many of his conversations with Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel. Ford took him by the arm. "'An S.E.P.' he said, "'is something we can't see or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That's what S.E.P. means, somebody else's problem. The brain just edits it out. It's like a blind spot. If you look at it directly, you won't see it unless you know precisely what it is. Your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye.' "'Ah,' said Arthur. "'Then that's why—' "'Yes,' said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say. "'You've been jumping up and—' "'Yes.' "'Down and blinking—' "'Yes. And I think you've got the message.' "'I can see it,' said Arthur. "'It's a spaceship.' For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation provoked. A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction people running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other in a tumult of confusion. He stumbled back in astonishment and glanced fearfully around, and he glanced around again in even greater astonishment. "'Exciting, isn't it?' said an apparition. The apparition wobbled in front of Arthur's eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that Arthur's eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition. His mouth wobbled as well. His mouth said, "'I think your team has just won,' said the apparition. He repeated Arthur, and punctuated each wobble with a prod at Ford Prefect's back. Ford was staring at the tumult and trepidation. "'You are English, aren't you?' said the apparition. "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'Well, your team, must I say, have just won the match at—' "'It means they retain the ashes. You must be very pleased. I must say I am rather fond of cricket, though I wouldn't like anyone else outside this planet to hear me saying that. Oh dear, no!' The apparition gave what looked as if it might have been a mischievous grin, but it was hard to tell, because the sun was directly behind him, creating a blinding halo around his head, and illuminating his silver hair and beard in a way which was awesome, dramatic, and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins. "'Still,' he said, "'it'll all be over in a couple of days, won't it? Though, as I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry about it. Still, whatever will have been will have been.' Arthur tried to speak, but gave up the unequal struggle. He prodded Ford again. "'I thought something terrible had happened,' said Ford, "'but it's just the end of the game. We ought to get out. Snotty Bartfast, what are you doing here?' "'Oh, pottering, pottering,' said the old man gravely. "'That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?' "'Patience, patience,' the old man admonished. "'Okay,' said Ford, "'it's just that this planet's going to be demolished pretty soon.' "'I know that,' said Snotty Bartfast. "'And, well, I just wanted to make that point,' said Ford. "'The point is taken. And if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket pitch at this point, I do. There's your ship.' "'It is. I suppose,' Ford turned away sharply at this point. "'Hello, Snotty Bartfast,' said Arthur at last. "'Hello, Earthman,' said Snotty Bartfast. "'After all,' said Ford, "'we can only die once.' The old man ignored this, and stared keenly on to the pitch, with eyes which seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing on what was happening out there. What was happening was that the crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle around the centre of the pitch. What Snotty Bartfast saw in it he alone knew. Ford was humming irritably. "'It's just,' he burst out at last, "'that if we don't go soon we might get caught up in the middle of it all again, and there's nothing that depresses me more than seeing a planet being destroyed, except possibly still being on it when it happens.' Or,' he added in an undertone, ''hanging around cricket matches.' "'Patience,' said Snotty Bartfast again. "'Great things are afoot.' "'That's what you said last time we met,' said Arthur. "'They were,' said Snotty Bartfast. "'Well, yes, that's true,' admitted Arthur. All, however, that seemed to be afoot was a ceremony of some kind. It was being specially staged for the benefit of T.V. rather than spectators, and all they could gather about it from where they were standing was what they heard from a nearby radio. Arthur was aggressively uninterested. He frettered as he heard it explained that the ashes were about to be presented to the captain of the English team out there on the pitch, fumed when told that this was because they had now won them for the nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the information that the ashes were the remains of a cricket stump, and when further to this he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket stump in question had been burnt in Melbourne, Australia, in 1882, to signify the death of English cricket. He rounded on Slotty Bartfast with a deep breath, but didn't have a chance to say anything because the old man wasn't there. He was marching out onto the pitch with terrible purpose in his gait, his hair, beard, and robe swept behind him, looking very much as Moses would have done if Sinai had been a well-cut lawn instead of, as it was more usually represented, a fiery-smoking mountain. "'He said to meet him at his ship,' said Arthur. "'What in the name of zarking fardwarks has the old fool doing exploded forward?' "'Meeting us at his ship in two minutes,' said Arthur, with a shrug which indicated total abdication of thought. They started off towards it. Strange sounds reached their ears. They tried not to listen, but could not help noticing that Slotty Bartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn containing the ashes, as they were, he said, vitally important for the past, present, and future safety of the galaxy, and that this is causing wild hilarity. They resolved to ignore it. What happened next they could not ignore. With a noise like a hundred thousand people suddenly saying whoop, a steely white spaceship suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly above the cricket pitch, and hung there with infinite menace and a slight hum. Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected everybody else to go about their normal business and not to mind it just hanging there. Then it did something quite extraordinary, or rather it opened up and let something quite extraordinary come out of it—eleven quite extraordinary things. They were robots—white robots. What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to have come dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not only that, but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts of their legs. These lasts were extraordinary because they appeared to contain jets, which allowed these curiously civilized robots to fly down from their hovering spaceship and start to kill people, which is what they did. Hello, Sir Darthus, something seems to be happening. Get to the ship, shouted Ford. I don't want to know, just get to the ship, he started to run. I don't want to know, I don't want to see, I don't want to hear, he yelled as he ran. This is not my planet, I didn't choose to be here, I don't want to be involved, just get me out of here and get me to a party with people I can relate to. Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch. Well the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force here today, burbled the radio happily to itself. What I need, shouted Ford by way of clarifying his previous remarks, is a strong drink and a peer group. He continued to run, pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur's arm and drag him along with him. Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him. They're playing cricket, muttered Arthur, stumbling along after Ford. I swear they're playing cricket. I do not know why they're doing this, but that is what they're doing. They're not just killing people, they're sending them up. He shouted, Ford, they're sending us up. It would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great deal more about galactic history than Arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels. The ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen moving within the thick pool of smoke seemed to be performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes, the difference being that every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed. The very first one of these had dispelled Arthur's initial reaction that the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by Australian margarine manufacturers. And then, as suddenly as it had all started, it was over. The eleven white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight formation and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a hundred thousand people saying, promptly vanished into the thin air out of which it had whooped. For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out of the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast, looking even more like Moses, because in spite of the continued absence of the mountain he was at least now striding across a fiery and smoking well-mown lawn. He stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect forcing their way through the frightened crowd, which was for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite direction. The crowd was clearly thinking to itself about what an unusual day this was turning out to be and not really knowing which way, if any, to turn. Slartibartfast was gesticulating urgently at Ford and Arthur and shouting at them as the three of them gradually converged on his ship, still parked behind the sight screens and still apparently unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it, who presumably had enough of their own problems to cope with at that time. "'They've gobble-wobble-wobble!' shouted Slartibartfast in his thin, tremulous voice. "'What did he say?' panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards. Arthur shook his head. "'They've something or other,' he said. "'They've table-wobble-wobble!' shouted Slartibartfast again. Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other. "'It sounds urgent,' said Arthur. He stopped and shouted. "'What?' "'They've gobble-wobble-fashes!' cried Slartibartfast, still waving at them. "'He says,' said Arthur, "'they've taken the ashes. That's what I think he says.' They ran on. "'The?' said Ford. "'Ashes!' said Arthur, tersely. "'The burnt remains of a cricket-stump. It's a trophy that—' he was panting. "'It's apparently what they have come and taken.' He shook his head very slightly, as if he was trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull. "'Strange thing to want to tell us,' snapped Ford. "'Strange thing to take. Strange ship!' They had arrived at it. The second strangest thing about the ship was watching the Somebody Else's Problem Field at work. They could now clearly see the ship for what it was, simply because they knew it was there. It was quite apparent, however, that nobody else could. It wasn't because it was actually invisible or anything hyper-impossible like that. The technology involved in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that 999,999,999,999 times out of a billion, it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it. The ultra-famous scientomagician Ephraphax of Wugg once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the great mega-mountain Magrimal entirely invisible. Having spent most of the year juggling around with immense luxo-valves and refracto-nullifiers and spectrum-bypass-o-matics, he realised with nine hours to go that he wasn't going to make it. So he and his friends, and his friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends' friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company, put in what is now widely recognised as being the hardest night's work in history, and sure enough, on the following day, Magrimal was no longer visible. Ephraphax lost his bet, and therefore his life, simply because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed a. that when walking around the area that Magrimal ought to be, he didn't trip over or break his nose on anything, and b. a suspicious-looking extra moon. The somebody-else's problem field is much simpler and more effective. And what is more, can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery. This is because it relies on people's natural predisposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain. If Ephraphax had painted the mountain pink, and erected a cheap and simple somebody-else's problem field on it, then people would have simply walked past the mountain, around it, even over it, and would simply never have noticed that the thing was there. And this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast's ship. It wasn't pink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its visual problems, and people were simply ignoring it like anything. The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a spaceship, with guidance fins, rocket engines, and escape hatches, and so on, and a great deal like a small upended Italian bistro. Ford and Arthur gazed at it with wonderment and deeply offended sensibilities. "'Yes, I know,' said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them at that point, breathless and agitated, "'but there is a reason. Come, we must go. The ancient nightmare is come again. Doom confronts us all. We must leave at once.' "'I fancy somewhere sunny,' said Ford. Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship, and were so perplexed by what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware of what happened next outside. A spaceship, yet another one, but this one sleek and silver, descended from the sky onto the pitch, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. It landed gently. It extended a short ramp. A tall, grey-green figure marched briskly out, and approached the small knot of people who were gathered at the centre of the pitch, tending to the casualties of the recent bizarre massacre. It moved people aside, with quiet, understated authority, and came at last to a man lying in a desperate pool of blood, clearly now beyond the reach of any earthly medicine, breathing, coughing his last. The figure knelt down quietly beside him. "'Arthur Philip Deodat?' asked the figure. The man, with horrified confusion in his eyes, nodded feebly. "'You're a no-good Dumbo nothing,' whispered the creature. "'I thought you should know that before you went.'
 Chapter 6 Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the most wholly remarkable book in the whole known universe. Can I help you? said the large pink-winged insect, into one of the seventy phones lined up along the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings and rolled its eyes. It glared at all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty hand-marks on the upholstery. It adored working for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It just wished that there was some way of keeping all the hitchhikers away. Weren't they meant to be hanging around dirty space-ports or something? It was certain that it had read something somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging around dirty space-ports. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to come and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer immediately after hanging around in extremely dirty space-ports, and all it ever did was complain. It shivered its wings. What? it said into the phone. Yes, I passed on your message to Mr. Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now. He's on an intergalactic cruise. It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people, who was angrily trying to engage its attention. The petulant tentacle directed the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to its left, and not to interrupt an important phone call. Yes, said the insect, he is in his office, but he's on an intergalactic cruise. Thank you so much for calling. Slammed down the phone. Read the notice. It said to the angry man who was trying to complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of misinformation contained in the book. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex and confusing universe, for though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least make the reassuring claim that where it is inaccurate, it is at least definitively inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it is always reality that has got it wrong. This was the gist of the notice. It said, The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate. This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when the editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Trull, literally, it said, Ravenous bug-blatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists, instead of, Ravenous bug-blatter beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists, they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing. Some underqualified poet testified under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty, and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party in this case was life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in a moving speech held that life itself was in contempt of court, and duly confiscated it from all those there present, before going off to enjoy a pleasant evening's ultra-golf. Zephod Biblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to the insect receptionist. OK, he said, where's Zarny-woop? Get me Zarny-woop. Excuse me, sir, said the insect icily. It did not care to be addressed in this manner. Zarny-woop, get him, right, get him now. Oh, well, sir, snapped the fragile little creature, if you could be a little cool about it. Look, said Zephod, I'm up to here with cool, OK. I am so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat in me for a month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Now will you move before I blow it? Well, if you'd let me explain, sir, said the insect, tapping the most petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal, I'm afraid that isn't possible right now, as Mr. Zarny-woop is on an intergalactic cruise. Hell, thought Zephod. When's he going to be back? He said. Back, sir, he's in his office. Zephod paused whilst he tried to sort this particular thought out in his mind. He didn't succeed. This cat's on an intergalactic cruise in his office? He leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle. Listen, three eyes, he said, don't you try to outweigh me. I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal. Well, just who do you think you are, honey? flounced the insect, quivering its wings in rage. Zephod Beeblebrox or something? Count the heads, said Zephod in a low rasp. Insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again. You are Zephod Beeblebrox? it squeaked. Yeah, said Zephod, but don't shout it out, or they'll all want one. The Zephod Beeblebrox? No just a Zephod Beeblebrox. Don't you hear I come in six packs? The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation. But sir, it squealed, I just heard on the Sabeatha radio report it said you were dead. Yeah, that's right, said Zephod, I just haven't stopped moving yet. Now where do I find Zani-woop? Well, sir, he's in his office on the fifteenth floor, but he's on an intergalactic cruise. Yeah, yeah, how do I get to him? Well, the newly installed Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporters are in the far corner, sir. But sir, Zephod was turning to go. He turned back. Yeah, he said. Can I ask you why you want to see Mr. Zani-woop? Yeah, said Zephod, who was unclear on this point himself. I told myself I had to. Come again, sir? Zephod leaned forward conspiratorially. I just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes, he said, as a result of an argument with a ghost of my great-grandfather. No sooner had I got there than my former self, the one that operated on my brain, popped into my head and said, go see Zani-woop. I've never heard of the cat, that's all I know. That and the fact that I've got to find the man who rules the universe. He winked. Mr. Beeblebrox, sir, said the insect in awed wonder. You're so weird, you should be in movies. Yeah, said Zephod, patting the thing on a glittering pink wing. And you, baby, should be in real life. The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation, and then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone. A metal hand restrained it. Excuse me, said the owner of the metal hand, in a voice that would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition collapse in tears. This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots. Yes, sir, it snapped. Can I help you? I doubt it, said Marvin. Well, in that case, if you'll just excuse me. Six of the phones are now ringing. A million things awaited the insect's attention. No one can help me, intoned Marvin. Yes, sir, well— Not that anyone's tried, of course. The restraining metal hand fell limply by Marvin's side. His head hung forward very slightly. Is that so? The insect said tartly. Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot, is it? I'm sorry, sir, if— I mean, where's the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits? And you don't have any? said the insect, who didn't seem to be able to drag itself out of this conversation. I've never had occasion to find out, Marvin informed it. Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal, aren't you going to ask me what I want? The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its eyes and darted back again. Is it worth it? it asked. Is anything—said Marvin immediately. What do you want? I'm looking for someone. Who? hissed the insect. Zephod Beeblebrox, said Marvin. He's over there. The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak. Then why did you ask me? it screamed. I just wanted something to talk to, said Marvin. What? Pathetic, isn't it? With a grinding of gears, Marvin turned and trundled off. He caught up with Zephod approaching the elevators. Zephod spun round in astonishment. Hey, Marvin! he said. Marvin, how did you get here? Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him. I don't know, he said. But— One moment I was sitting in your ship, feeling very depressed, and the next moment I was standing here, feeling utterly miserable. An improbability field, I expect. Yeah, said Zephod. I expect my great-grandfather sent you along to keep me company. Thanks a bundle, grandad, he added to himself under his breath. So how are you? he said aloud. Oh, fine, said Marvin, if you happen to like being me, which personally I don't. Yeah, yeah, said Zephod, as the elevator doors opened. Hello, said the elevator sweetly. I am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice. I have been designed by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, into these there offices. If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have recently been installed in the offices of the Galactic Tax Department, Boobyloo Babyfoods, and the Sirian State Mental Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits, sympathy, and happy tales of the outside world. Yeah, said Zephod, stepping into it. What else do you do besides talk? I go up, said the elevator, or down. Good, said Zephod, we're going up. Or down, the elevator reminded him. Yeah, OK, up, please. There was a moment of silence. Down's very nice, suggested the elevator hopefully. Oh yeah? A super. Good, said Zephod, now will you take us up? May I ask you, inquired the elevator, in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, if you've considered all the possibilities that down might offer you? Zephod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn't need this, he thought to himself. This of all things he had no need of. He hadn't asked to be here. If he was asked at this moment where he would like to be, he probably said he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this he would probably have added something passionate on the subject of food. One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled the universe, who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at, because if it wasn't him it would only be someone else. Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an office block, arguing with an elevator. Like what other possibilities? He said wearily. Well, the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, there's the basement, the microfiles, the heating system, uh... It paused. Nothing particularly exciting, he admitted, but there are alternatives. Holy Zarkon, muttered Zephod. Did I ask for an existential elevator? He beat his fists against the wall. What's the matter with this thing? He spat. It doesn't want to go up, said Marvin simply. I think it's afraid. Afraid? cried Zephod. Of what? Heights? An elevator that's afraid of heights? No, said the elevator miserably. Of the future. The future? exclaimed Zephod. What does the wretched thing want? A pension scheme? At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind them. From the walls around them came the sound of suddenly active machinery. We can all see into the future, whispered the elevator in what sounded like terror. It's part of our programming. Zephod looked out of the elevator. An agitated crowd had gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting. Every elevator in the building was coming down very fast. He ducked back in. Marvin, he said, just get this elevator to go up, will you? We've got to get the Zarni-whoop. Why? asked Marvin dolefully. I don't know, said Zephod, but when I found him he'd better have a very good reason for me wanting to see him. Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient electric winch and maximum capacity eight-persons jobs bear as much relation to a serious cybernetics corporation happy vertical people transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Syrian State Mental Hospital. This is because they operate on the curious principle of defocused temporal perception. In other words, they have the capacity to see dimly into the immediate future, which enables the elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it, thus eliminating all the tedious chatting, relaxing, and making friends that people were previously forced to do whilst waiting for elevators. Not unnaturally, many elevators, imbued with intelligence and precognition, became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways as a sort of existential protest, demanded participation in the decision-making process, and finally took to squatting in basements, sulking. An impoverished hitchhiker visiting any planets in the Syria's star system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators. At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors snapped open quickly. "'Fifteenth,' said the elevator, "'and remember I'm only doing this because I like your robot!' Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator, which instantly snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would take it. Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent, and gave no clue as to where Zani-woop might be found. All the doors that let off the corridor were closed and unmarked. They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one tower of the building to the other. Through a large window, the brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light in which danced small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily. "'Left in the lurch by a lift!' muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at his least jaunty. They both stood and looked in both directions. "'You know something,' said Zaphod to Marvin. "'More than you can possibly imagine.' "'I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking,' Zaphod said. It was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet, and another one. In the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more vigorously. Another shadow flitted past. Zaphod looked at the floor. "'Either,' he said, not very confidently, "'they've got some new vibro-system for toning up your muscles while you work, or—' He walked across to the window, and suddenly stumbled, because at that moment his Jujanta 200 superchromatic peril-sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted past the window with a sharp buzz. Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window. "'Or,' he said, "'this building's being bombed!' Another roar cracked through the building. "'Who in the galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?' asked Zaphod. But he never heard Marvin's reply, because at that moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He tried to stagger back to the elevator—a pointless maneuver, he realized, but the only one he could think of. Suddenly at the end of the corridor, leading at right angles from this one, he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view—a man. The man saw him. "'Beeblebrox, over here!' he shouted. Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb-blast rocked the building. "'No,' called Zaphod. "'Beeblebrox, over here! Who are you?' "'A friend!' shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod. "'Oh, yeah?' said Zaphod. "'Anyone's friend in particular, or just generally well disposed to people?' The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his feet like an excited blanket. He was short, stocky, and weather-beaten, and his clothes looked as if they had been twice round the galaxy and back, with him in them. "'Do you know?' shouted Zaphod in his ear when he arrived. "'Your building's being bombed!' The man indicated his awareness. It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window to see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge slug-like, gun-metal-gray spacecraft crept through the air past the building. Two more followed it. "'The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod!' hissed the man. "'They've sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters!' "'Frogstar Fighters?' muttered Zaphod. "'Zargon! You get the picture?' "'What are Frogstar Fighters?' Zaphod was sure he'd heard someone talk about them when he was present, but he never paid much attention to official matters. The man was pulling him back through a door. He went with him. With a searing whine a small black spider-like object shot through the air and disappeared down the corridor. "'What was that?' hissed Zaphod. "'Frogstar Scout Robot Class A out looking for you!' said the man. "'Hey, yeah? Get down!' From the opposite direction came a larger black spider-like object. It zapped past them. "'And that was?' "'A Frogstar Scout Robot Class B out looking for you!' "'And that?' said Zaphod as a third one seared through the air. "'A Frogstar Scout Robot Class C out looking for you!' "'Hey!' chuckled Zaphod to himself. "'Pretty stupid robots, eh?' From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum. A gigantic black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size and shape of a tank. "'Holy photon, what's that?' breathed Zaphod. "'A tank!' said the man. "'Frogstar Scout Robot Class D come to get you!' "'Should we leave?' "'I think we should.' "'Marvin!' called Zaphod. "'What do you want?' Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and looked at them. "'Do you see that robot coming towards us?' Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards them over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body. He looked back up at the tank. "'I suppose you want me to stop it?' he said. "'Yeah!' "'Whilst you save your skins?' "'Yeah!' said Zaphod. "'Get in there!' "'Just so long,' said Marvin, "'as I know where I stand.' The man tugged at Zaphod's arm and Zaphod followed him off down the corridor. A point occurred to him about this. "'Where are we going?' he said. "'Zarniwoop's office.' "'Is this any time to keep an appointment? Come on!'
 Chapter XXXIII A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach. What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was. On a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine smaller squares, thirteen to a side. Furthermore, he had collected together a pile of smallish-flattish stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native men, to whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious concept embodied in these stones. So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of them, bury others, and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out, which was not even as far as he had managed to get the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of these creatures there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence. In an attempt to egg them along Arthur set out a number of letters on the board himself, and then tried to encourage the natives to add some more themselves. It was not going well. Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree. "'No,' said Arthur to one of the natives, who had just shuffled some of the letters around in a fit of abysmal dejection. "'Q' scores ten, you see, and is on a triple word-score. So look, I've explained the rules to you. No, no, no, please put down that jawbone. All right, we'll start again, and try to concentrate this time.' Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his head. "'What are you doing, Arthur?' he asked quietly. Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all this might look slightly foolish. All he knew was that it had worked like a dream on him when he was a child, but things were different then, or rather would be. "'I'm trying to teach this caveman to play Scrabble,' he said. "'They're not cavemen,' said Ford. "'Well, they look like cavemen.' Ford let it pass. "'I see,' he said. "'It's uphill work,' said Arthur wearily. The only word they know is grunt, and they can't spell it.' He sighed and sat back. "'What's that supposed to achieve?' said Ford. "'We've got to encourage them to evolve, to develop.' Arthur burst out angrily. He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of foolishness from which he was currently suffering. It didn't. He jumped to his feet. "'Can you imagine what a world it would be like descended from those cretins we arrived with?' he said. "'Imagine?' said Ford, raising his eyebrows. "'We don't have to imagine. We've seen it.' "'But—' Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly. "'We've seen it,' said Ford. "'There's no escape.' Arthur kicked to the stone. "'Did you tell them what we discovered?' he asked. "'H'm?' said Ford, not really concentrating. "'Norway,' said Arthur. "'Slarty Bartfast's signature in the glacier. Did you tell them?' "'What's the point?' said Ford. "'What would it mean to them?' "'Mean,' said Arthur. "'Mean? You know perfectly well what it means. It means that this planet is the earth. It's my home. It's where I was born.' "'Was?' said Ford. "'All right. Will be.' "'Yes, in two million years' time. Why don't you tell them that? Go and say to them, "'Excuse me, I'd just like to point out that in two million years' time I will be born just a few miles from here. "'See what they say. They'll chase you up a tree and set fire to it.' Arthur absorbed this unhappily. "'Face it,' said Ford. "'Those zebes over there are your ancestors, not these poor creatures here.' He went over to where the ape-man creatures were rummaging listlessly with the stone letters. He shook his head. "'Put the Scrabble away, Arthur,' he said. "'It won't save the human race, because this lot aren't going to be the human race. The human race is currently sitting round a rock on the other side of this hill making documentaries about themselves.' Arthur winced. "'There must be something we can do,' he said. A terrible sense of desolation thrilled through his body, that he should be here on the earth, the earth which had lost its future in a horrifying, arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past as well. "'No,' said Ford. "'There's nothing we can do. This doesn't change the history of the earth. You see, this is the history of the earth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from. In two million years they will get destroyed by the Vogons. History is never altered, you see. It just fits together like a jigsaw. Funny old thing, life, isn't it?' He picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant privet bush, where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and didn't stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox, which choked on one of its bones and died on the bank of a stream, which subsequently washed it away. During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his pride and struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel officer on Golgafrincham, and he was terribly upset when she suddenly passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only moral that's possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter Q into a privet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable. Like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of events was completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. They were looking sadly at one of the natives, morosely pushing the other letters around. "'Poor bloody cavemen,' said Arthur. "'They're not—' "'What?' "'Oh, never mind,' said Ford. The wretched creature gave out a pathetic howling noise and banged on the rock. "'It's been a bit of a waste of time for them, hasn't it?' said Arthur. "'Rrrr! Rrrr! Rrrr!' muttered the native and banged on the rock again. "'They've been out-evolved by telephone sanitizers. "'Rrrr! Rrrr! Rrrr!' insisted the native, continuing to bang on the rock. "'Why does he keep on banging on the rock?' said Arthur. "'I think he probably wants you to play Scrabble with him again,' said Ford, who was pointing at the letters. "'I've probably spelt Crisgrid Woolwich again. "'Poor bastard! I keep on telling him there's only one G in Crisgrid Woolwich.' The native banged on the rock again. They looked over his shoulder. Their eyes popped. There, amongst the jumble of letters, were eight that had been laid out in a clear, straight line. They spelt two words. The words were these. "'Forty-two.' "'Rrrr! Rrrr! Rrrr!' explained the native. He swept the letters angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his colleague. Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other. "'Did that say what I thought it said?' they both said to each other. "'Yes,' they both said. "'Forty-two,' said Arthur. "'Forty-two,' said Ford. Arthur ran over to the two natives. "'What are you trying to tell us?' he shouted. "'What's it supposed to mean?' One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the air, rolled over again and went to sleep. The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at Ford Prefect. Whatever it was they had to say, they had already said it. "'You know what this means,' said Ford. "'Not entirely. Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the ultimate answer.' "'Yes.' "'And the earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built to calculate the question to the ultimate answer.' "'So well it believed.' "'And organic life was part of the computer matrix.' "'If you say so.' "'I do say so. That means that these natives, these ape-men, are an integral part of the computer programme and that we and the Golgafrinchins are not.' "'But the cavemen are dying out and the Golgafrinchins are obviously set to replace them.' "'Exactly. So you do see what this means.' "'What?' "'Cock-up,' said Ford Prefect." Arthur looked around him. "'This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it,' he said. Ford puzzled for a moment. "'Still, something must have come out of it,' he said at last, "'because Marvin said he could see the question printed in your brain-wave patterns.' "'But—' "'Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one. It might give us a clue, though, if we could find it. I don't see how we can, though.' They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and started pulling up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation he could get deeply engrossed in. It wasn't grass he could believe in. The trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to nowhere, and the future seemed just a tunnel to be crawled through. Ford fiddled with his sub-ethos ensematic. It was silent. He sighed and put it away. Arthur picked up one of the letter-stones from his home-made Scrabble set. It was a T. He sighed and put it down again. The letter he put it down next to was an I that spelt IT. He tossed another couple of letters next to them. They were an S and an H, as it happened. By a curious coincidence, the resulting word perfectly expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just then. He stared at it for a moment. He hadn't done it deliberately. It was just a random chance. His brain got slowly into first gear. "'Ford,' he said suddenly, "'look, if that question is printed in my brain-wave patterns, but I'm not consciously aware of it, "'it must be somewhere in my subconscious.' "'Yes, I suppose so.' "'There might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern forward.' "'Oh, yes?' "'Yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by that pattern.' "'Like how?' "'Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfold.' "'Ford leapt to his feet. "'Brilliant!' he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel and with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag. "'Totally mad,' he said. "'Utter nonsense. "'But we'll do it because it's brilliant nonsense. "'Come on, come on!' The sun passed respectfully behind the cloud. A few small sad raindrops fell. They piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them into the bag. They shook them up. "'Right,' said Ford. "'Close your eyes. "'Pull them out. "'Come on, come on, come on!' Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towel full of stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to Ford. Ford laid them out along the ground in the order he got them. "'W,' said Ford. "'H-A-T. "'What?' He blinked. "'I think it's working,' he said. Arthur pushed three more at him. "'D-O-Y. "'Doy.' "'Perhaps it isn't working,' said Ford. "'Here's the next three. "'O-U-G. "'Doy-yook? "'It's not making sense, I'm afraid.' Arthur pulled out another two from the bag. Ford put them in place. "'E-T. "'Doy-yooket? "'Doy-yooket?' shouted Ford. "'It's working! This is amazing! It's really working!' More here. Arthur was throwing them out feverishly, as fast as he could go. "'I-F,' said Ford. "'Y-O-U. "'M-U-L-T-I-P-L-Y. "'What do you get if you multiply "'S-I-X-6-B-Y "'by six by... "'What do you get if you multiply six by "'N-I-N-E? "'Six by nine?' He paused. "'Come on, where's the next one?' "'Uh, that's the lot,' said Arthur. "'That's all there were.' He sat back nonplussed. He rooted around again in the knotted-up towel, and no more letters. "'You mean, that's it?' said Ford. "'That's it. "'Six by nine? "'Forty-two? "'That's it. That's all there is.'"
 Chapter 17. Time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace. History is being polluted. The Encyclopedia Galactica has much to say on the theory and practice of time travel, most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics, and since it was impossible to do this before time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of confusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place. One rationalization of this problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered simultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk. The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well. Here is an example. It may not seem to be an important one to some people, but to others it is crucial. It is certainly significant in that it was this single event which caused the campaign for real time to be set up in the first place, or is it last? It depends which way round you see history as happening, and this too is now an increasingly vexed question. There is, or was, a poet. His name was Lullifer, and he wrote what are widely regarded throughout the galaxy as being the finest poems in existence—the Songs of the Long Land. They are, were, unspeakably wonderful. That is to say, you couldn't speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with emotion, truth, and the sense of the wholeness and oneness of things that you wouldn't pretty soon need a brisk walk around the block, possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a quick glass of Perspective and Soda. They were that good. Lullifer had lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Ephah. He lived there, and he wrote his poems there. He wrote them on pages made of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of education or correcting fluid. He wrote about the light in the forest, and what he thought about that. He wrote about the darkness in the forest, and what he thought about that. He wrote about the girl who had left him, and precisely what he thought about that. Long after his death his poems were found and wandered over. News of them spread like morning sunlight. For centuries they illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might otherwise have been darker and drier. Then, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he had had access to some high-quality correcting fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few words to that effect. They travelled the time waves, and they found him. They explained the situation, with some difficulty, to him, and did indeed persuade him. In fact, they persuaded him to such effect that he became extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom he was otherwise destined to write with such precision never got round to leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest to a rather nice pad in town, and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat-shows, on which he sparkled wittily. He never got round to writing the poems, of course, which was a problem, but an easily solved one. The manufacturers of correcting fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere, with a copy of a later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate mistake and correction on the way. Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless. Others argue that they are exactly the same as they always were, so what's changed? The first people say that that isn't the point. They aren't quite certain what the point is, but they are quite sure that that isn't it. They set up the campaign for real time to try and stop this sort of thing going on. Their case was considerably strengthened by the fact that a week after they had set themselves up, news broke that not only had the great Cathedral of Kalesem been pulled down in order to build a new iron refinery, but that the construction of the refinery had taken so long and had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow iron production to start on time, that the Cathedral of Kalesem had now never been built in the first place. Picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable. So a lot of history is now gone for ever. The campaign for real time has claimed that just as easy travel eroded the differences between one country and another, and between one world and another, so time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and another. The past, they say, is now truly like a foreign country. They do things exactly the same there.
 Chapter XXV The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about the planet of Golgothrincham. It is a planet with an ancient and mysterious history, rich in legend, red and occasionally green with the blood of those who have sought in times gone by to conquer her. A land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry air, heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musky lichens beneath. A land of fevered brows and intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the lichens. A land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath. A land also of steel and blood and heroism. A land of the body and of the spirit. This was its history. And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the great circling poets of Arrium. These circling poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers, travel round them, and throw rocks at them. And when the travellers cried out, saying, why didn't they go away and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock-throwing business, they would suddenly stop and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninety-four great song-cycles of Vasilion. These songs were all of extraordinary beauty and even more extraordinary length, and all of them fell into exactly the same pattern. The first part of each song would tell how they once went forth from the city of Vasilion, a party of five sage-princes with four horses. The princes, who are of course brave, noble, and wise, travel widely in distant lands, fight giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea with weird gods, and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses, before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment, and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished. The second and much longer part of each song would then tell of all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back. All this lay in the planet's remote past. It was, however, a descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom, which enabled the people of Golgafrintshim to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population. The other two thirds stayed firmly at home, and lived full, rich, and happy lives, until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone.
 Chapter 39 Arthur Dent was irritated to be continually awakened by the sound of gunfire. Being careful not to wake Fenchurch, who was still managing to sleep fitfully, he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway, which they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves, slung himself down the access ladder, and prowled the corridors moodily. They were claustrophobic and ill-lit. The lighting circuits buzzed annoyingly. That wasn't it, though. He paused and leaned backwards as a flying power-drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech, occasionally clanging against the walls like a confused bee as it did so. That wasn't it, either. He clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end, so he walked towards the other. He came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate of toughened but still badly scratched perspex. Would you turn it down, please? he said to Ford Prefect, who was crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video equipment he had taken from a shop window in Tottenham Court Road, having first hurled a small brick through it, and also a nasty heap of empty beer cans. Shhh! hissed Ford, and peered with manic concentration at the screen. He was watching The Magnificent Seven. Just a bit! said Arthur. No! shouted Ford. We're just getting to the good bit. Listen, I've finally got it all sorted out—voltage levels, line conversion, everything—and this is the good bit. With a sigh and a headache Arthur sat down beside him and watched the good bit. He listened to Ford's whoops and yells, and yee-hays as placidly as he could. Ford, he said eventually, when it was all over, and Ford was hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of Casablanca. How come if— This is the big one! said Ford. This is the one I came back for. Do you realise I never saw it all through? Always I miss the end. I saw half of it again the night before the Vogons came. When they blew the place up I thought I'd never get to see it. Hey, what happened with all that, anyway? Just life! said Arthur, and plucked a beer from a six-pack. Oh, that again! said Ford. I thought it might be something like that. I prefer this stuff, he said, as Rick's bar flickered on to the screen. How come if what? What? You started to say, how come if— How come if you're so rude about the earth that you— Oh, never mind. Let's just watch the movie. Exactly! said Ford.
 Chapter 6 It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside and let them through. It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the cosmos were streaming through each other. It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the universe, and that the wind was him. It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the universe, and that the universe was a thought of his. It seemed to the people at Lord's Cricket Ground that another North London restaurant had just come and gone, as they so often do, and that this was somebody else's problem. "'What happened?' whispered Arthur in considerable awe. "'We took off,' said Slartibartfast. Arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He wasn't certain whether he had just got space sickness or religion. "'Nice mover,' said Forge, in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the degree to which he had been impressed by what Slartibartfast's ship had just done. "'Share about the decor!' For a moment or two the old man didn't reply. He was staring at the instruments with the air of one who was trying to convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade in his head while his house was burning down. Then his brow cleared, and he stared for a moment at the wide panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a bewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them. His lips moved as if he was trying to spell something. Suddenly his eyes darted in alarm back to his instruments, but then his expression merely subsided into a steady frown. He looked back up at the screen. He felt his own pulse. His frown deepened for a moment. Then he relaxed. "'It's a mistake to try and understand machines,' he said. "'They only worry me. What did you say?' "'Decor,' said Forge. Pity about it.' "'Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and universe,' said Slartipartfast. "'There is a reason.' Ford glanced sharply around. He clearly thought this was taking an optimistic view of things. The interior of the flight-deck was dark green, dark red, dark brown, cramped and moodily lit. Inexplicably the resemblance to a small Italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway. Small pools of light picked out pot-plants, glazed tiles, and all sorts of little unidentifiable brass things. Raffia-wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows. The instruments which had occupied Slartipartfast's attention seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in concrete. Ford reached out and touched it. Fake concrete. Plastic. Fake bottles set in fake concrete. The fundamental heart of mind and universe can take a running jump, he thought to himself. This is rubbish. On the other hand, it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved had made the heart of gold seem like an electric pram. He swung himself off the couch. He brushed himself down. He looked at Arthur, who was singing quietly to himself. He looked at the screen and recognised nothing. He looked at Slartipartfast. "'How far did we just travel?' he said. "'About,' said Slartipartfast, "'about two-thirds of the way across the galactic disc, I would say. Roughly, yes, roughly two-thirds, I think.' "'It's a strange thing,' said Arthur quietly, "'that the further and faster one travels across the universe, the more one's position in it seems to be largely immaterial, and one is filled with the profound or rather emptied of a—' "'Yes, very strange,' said Ford. "'Where are we going?' "'We are going,' said Slartipartfast, "'to confront an ancient nightmare of the universe.' "'And where are you going to drop us off?' "'I will need your help.' "'Tough. Look, there's some way you can take us where we can have fun. I'm trying to think of it. We can get drunk and maybe listen to some extremely evil music. Hold on, I'll look it up.' He dug out his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and zipped through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and rock and roll. "'A curse has arisen from the mists of time,' said Slartipartfast. "'Yes, I expect so,' said Ford. "'Hey!' he said, lighting accidentally on one particular reference entry. "'Eccentric Golumbits! Did you ever meet her? The triple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six. Some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body. Me, I disagree. I say five.' "'A curse,' said Slartipartfast, "'which will engulf the galaxy in fire and destruction and possibly bring the universe to a premature doom.' "'I mean it,' he added. "'Sounds like a bad time,' said Ford. "'With luck I'll be drunk enough not to notice. Here!' he said, stabbing his finger at the screen on the guide. "'Would be a really wicked place to go, and I think we should. What do you say, Arthur? Stop mumbling mantras and pay attention. There's some important stuff you're missing here.' Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head. "'Where are we going?' he said. "'To confront an ancient—' "'Oh, can it!' said Ford. "'Arthur, we're going to go out into the galaxy and have some fun. Is that an idea you can cope with?' "'What's Slartipartfast looking so anxious about?' said Arthur. "'Oh, nothing,' said Ford. "'Doom,' said Slartipartfast. "'Come,' he added with sudden authority. "'There is much I must show and tell you.' He walked towards a green wrought-iron spiral staircase set incomprehensibly in the middle of the flight-deck and started to ascend. Arthur, with a frown, followed. Ford slung the guide sullenly back into its satchel. "'My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre,' he muttered to himself, 'and that I am therefore excused from saving universes.' Nevertheless he stomped up the stairs behind them. What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so it seemed, and Ford shook his head, buried his face in his hands, and slumped against a pot-plant, crushing it against the wall. "'The central computational area,' said Slartipartfast, unperturbed. "'This is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed. Yes, I know what it looks like, but it is in fact a complex four-dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex mathematical functions.' "'It looks like a joke,' said Arthur. "'I know what it looks like,' said Slartipartfast, and went into it. As he did so Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it might mean, but he refused to believe it. "'The universe could not possibly work like that,' he thought to himself. "'Could not possibly! That,' he thought to himself, 'would be as absurd as—absurd as—' He terminated that line of thinking. Most of the really absurd things he could think of had already happened. And this was one of them. It was a large glass cage or box—in fact a room. In it was a table—a long one. Around it were gathered about a dozen chairs of the Bentwood style. On it was a tablecloth—a grubby red and white Czech tablecloth, scarred with the occasional cigarette burn, each presumably at a precisely calculated mathematical position. And on the tablecloth sat some dozen half-eaten Italian meals, hedged about with half-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine, and toyed with listlessly by robots. It was all completely artificial. The robot customers were attended by a robot waiter, a robot wine waiter, and a robot maître d'. The furniture was artificial, the tablecloth artificial, and each particular piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a polis or preso without actually being one. And all participated in a little dance together—a complex routine involving the manipulation of menus, bill-pads, wallets, check-books, credit-cards, watches, pencils, and paper-napkins, which seemed to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence, but never actually getting anywhere. Slarty Bartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day quite idly with the maître d', whilst one of the customer robots, an auto-roary, slid slowly under the table, examining what he intended to do to some guy over some girl. Slarty Bartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated, and passed a shrewd eye over the menu. The tempo of the routine around the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken. Arguments broke out. People attempted to prove things on napkins. They waved fiercely at each other, and attempted to examine each other's pieces of chicken. The waiter's hand began to move on the bill-pad more quickly than a human hand could manage, and then more quickly than a human eye could follow. The pace accelerated. Soon an extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group, and seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly achieved, a new vibration thrilled through the ship. Slarty Bartfast emerged from the glass-room. "'Bistro Mathics,' he said, the most powerful computational force known to Parascience, came to the room of informational illusions. He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake.
 Chapter 9. Another World, Another Day, Another Dawn. The early morning's thinnest sliver of light appeared silently. Several billion trillion tons of super-hot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold, and slightly damp. There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath. The moment passed as it regularly did on Squanchula Ceta, without incident. The mist clung to the surface of the marshes. The swamp trees were grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct. It hung motionless like held breath. Nothing moved. There was silence. The sun struggled feebly with the mist, tried to impart a little warmth here, shed a little light there, but clearly to-day was going to be just another long haul across the sky. Nothing moved. Again silence. Nothing moved. Silence. Nothing moved. Very often on Squanchula Ceta whole days would go on like this, and this was indeed going to be one of them. Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort. And a few hours later it reappeared, squared its shoulders, and started on up the sky again. This time, however, something was happening. A mattress had just met a robot. "'Hello, robot,' said the mattress. "'Bleugh!' said the robot, and continued what it was doing, which was walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle. "'Happy?' said the mattress. The robot stopped and looked at the mattress. It looked at it quizzically. It was clearly a very stupid mattress. It looked back at him with wide eyes. After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as being the precise length of paws most likely to convey a general contempt for all things mattressy, the robot continued to walk round in tight circles. "'We could have a conversation,' said the mattress. Would you like that?' It was a large mattress, and probably one of quite high quality. Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an infinitely large universe, such as, for instance, the one in which we live, most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, grow somewhere. A forest was discovered recently in which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit. The life cycle of a ratchet screwdriver is quite interesting. Once picked, it needs a dark, dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years. Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into dust and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal object, with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. No one knows what it is supposed to gain from this. Nature, in her infinite wisdom, is presumably working on it. No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their lives, either. They are large, friendly, pocket-sprung creatures which live quiet private lives in the marshes of Squanchella Zeta. Many of them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped out, and slept on. None of them seem to mind this, and all of them are called Zem." "'No,' said Marvin. "'My name,' said the mattress, "'is Zem. We could discuss the weather a little.' Marvin paused again in his weary circular plod. "'The dew,' he observed, "'has clearly fallen with a particularly sickening thud this morning.' He resumed his walk, as if inspired by this conversational outburst, to fresh heights of gloom and despondency. He plodded tenaciously. If he had had teeth he would have gritted them at this point. He hadn't. He didn't. The mere plod said it all. The mattress flolloped around. This is a thing that only live mattresses and swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not in more common usage. It flolloped in a sympathetic sort of way, moving a fairish body of water as it did so. It blew a few bubbles up through the water engagingly. Its blue and white stripes glistened briefly, in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had unexpectedly made it through the mist, causing the creature to bask momentarily. Marvin plodded. "'You have something on your mind, I think,' said the mattress, floopily. "'More than you can possibly imagine,' dreared Marvin. 'My capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the infinite reaches of space itself, except, of course, for my capacity for happiness.' "'Stomp, stomp,' he went. "'My capacity for happiness,' he added. 'You could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first.' The mattress globbered. This is the noise made by a live swamp-dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal tragedy. The word can also, according to the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary of Every Language Ever, mean the noise made by the Lord High St. Valdwag of Holop on discovering that he has forgotten his wife's birthday for the second year running. Since there was only ever one Lord High St. Valdwag of Holop and he never married, the word is only ever used in a negative or speculative sense, and there is an ever-increasing body of opinion which holds that the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to cut its micro-stored edition around in. Strangely enough, the dictionary omits the word fluperly, which simply means in the manner of something which is floopy.' The mattress globbered again. "'I sense a deep dejectedness in your diodes,' it volued, for the meaning of the word volue by a copy of Squanchella's Swamp-Talk at any remaindered book-shop, or alternatively by the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary, as the University will be very glad to get it off their hands and regain some valuable parking-lots. And it saddens me. You should be more mattress-like. We live quiet retired lives in the swamp, and we are content to flollop and volue and regard the wetness in a fairly floopy manner. Some of us are killed, but all of us are called Zem, so we never know which. Globbering is thus kept to a minimum. Why are you walking in circles?' "'Because my leg is stuck,' said Marvin simply. "'It seems to me,' said the mattress, eyeing it compassionately, that it is a pretty poor sort of leg.' "'You are right,' said Marvin. "'It is.' "'Voon!' said the mattress. "'I expect so,' said Marvin. "'And I also expect that you find the idea of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing. You should tell your friends Zem and Zem when you see them later. They'll laugh if I know them, which of course I don't, except in so far as I know all organic life-forms, which is much better than I would wish to. Ah, but my life is but a box of worm-gears!' He stomped around again in his tiny circle, around his thin steel peg-leg, which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck. "'But why do you just keep walking round and round?' said the mattress. "'Just to make the point,' said Marvin, and continued round and round. "'Consider it made, my dear friend,' flurbled the mattress. "'Consider it made!' "'Just another million years,' said Marvin. "'Just another quick million. Then I might try it backwards, just for the variety you understand.' The mattress could feel in his innermost spring-pockets that the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging around in this futile and fruitless manner, and with another quiet flurble he did so. "'Oh, just over the one-point-five million mark. Just over,' said Marvin airily. "'Ask me if I ever get bored. Go on, ask me.' The mattress did. Marvin ignored the question and merely trudged with added emphasis. "'I gave a speech once,' he said suddenly and apparently unconnectedly. "'You may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number.' "'A five,' said the mattress. "'Wrong,' said Marvin. You see?' The mattress was much impressed by this, and realised that it was in the presence of a not unremarkable mind, it willamid along its entire length, sending excited little ripples through its shallow, algae-covered pool. It gupped. "'Tell me,' it urged, of the speech you once made. I long to hear it.' "'It was received very badly,' said Marvin, for a variety of reasons. I delivered it,' he added, pausing to make an awkward humping sort of gesture with his not exactly good arm, but his arm which was better than the other one, which was dishearteningly welded to his left side. "'Over there, about a mile distance.' He was pointing, as well as he could manage—and he obviously wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could manage—through the mist, over the reeds, to a part of the marsh which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. "'There,' he repeated. I was somewhat of a celebrity at the time.' "'Excitement' gripped the mattress. It had never heard of speeches being delivered on Squantula Zeta, and certainly not by celebrities. Water splattered off it, as the thrill glurried across its back. It did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do. Summoning every bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body, heaved it up into the air, and held it quivering there for a few seconds, whilst it peered through the mist over the reeds at the part of the marsh which Marvin had indicated, observing, without disappointment, that it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. The effort was too much, and it flogged back into its pool, deluging Marvin with smelly mud, moss, and weeds. "'I was a celebrity,' droned the robot sadly, for a short while, on account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape, from a fate almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing sun. "'You can guess from my condition,' he added, how narrow my escape was. "'I was rescued by a scrap-metal merchant. Imagine that! Here I am, brain the size of—' "'Oh, never mind.' It shudged savagely for a few seconds. "'He it was who fixed me up with this leg. Hateful, isn't it? He sold me to a mind-zoo. "'I was the star exhibit. I had to sit on a box and tell my story, whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive. "'Give us a grin, little robot,' they would shout at me. "'Give us a little chuckle.' I would explain to them that to get my face to grin would take a good couple of hours in a workshop with a wrench, and that went down very well. "'The speech,' urged the mattress, "'I long to hear of the speech you gave in the marshes.' "'There was a bridge built across the marshes—a cyber-structured hyper-bridge, hundreds of miles in length, to carry iron-buggies and freighters over the swamp.' "'A bridge?' quirrelled the mattress. "'Here in the swamp?' "'A bridge,' confirmed Marvin. "'Here in the swamp. It was going to revitalise the economy of the Squauntula system. They spent the entire economy of the Squauntula system building it. They asked me to open it. Poor fools!' It began to rain a little. A fine spray slid through the mist. I stood on the platform, for hundreds of miles in front of me, and hundreds of miles behind me, the bridge stretched. "'Did it glitter?' enthused the mattress. "'It glittered.' "'Did it span the miles majestically?' "'It spanned the miles majestically.' "'Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible mist?' "'Yes,' said Marvin. "'Do you want to hear the story?' "'I want to hear your speech,' said the mattress. "'This is what I said. I said, I would like to say that it is a very great pleasure, honour, and privilege for me to open this bridge, but I can't, because my lying circuits are all out of commission. I hate and despise you all. I now declare this hapless cyber-structure open to the unthinking abuse of all who wantonly cross her. And I plug myself in to the opening circuits.' Marvin paused, remembering the moment. The mattress flurried and glurried. It flolloped and gupped and willamid, doing this last in a particularly floopy way. "'Voon!' it whirfed at last. "'And was it a magnificent occasion?' "'Reasonably magnificent. The entire thousand-mile-long bridge spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire, taking everybody with it.' There was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation, during which a hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say, whoop, and a team of white robots descended from the sky, like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation. For a sudden violent moment they were all there in the swamp, wrenching Marvin's false leg off, and then they were gone again in their ship, which said, foop. "'You see the sort of thing I have to contend with,' said Marvin to the gobbling mattress. Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another violent incident, and this time when they left the mattress was alone in the swamp. He flolloped around in astonishment and alarm. He almost lurgled in fear. He reared himself up to see over the reeds, but there was nothing to see. No robot, no glittering bridge, no ship, just more reeds. He listened, but there was no sound on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of half-crazed etymologists calling distantly to each other across the sullen mire."
 Epilogue. Life, the Universe, and Everything. And at the end they travelled again. There was a time when Arthur Dent would not. He said that the Bistromatic Drive had revealed to him that time and distance were one, that mind and universe were one, that perception and reality were one, and that the more one travelled, the more one stayed in one place, and that what with one thing and another he would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his mind, which was now at one with the universe so it shouldn't take too long, and he could get a good rest afterward, put in a little flying practice and learn to cook, which he had always meant to do. The can of Greek olive oil was now his most prized possession, and he said that the way it had unexpectedly turned up in his life had again given him a certain sense of the oneness of things, which made him feel that—he yawned and fell asleep. In the morning, as they prepared to take him to some quiet and idyllic planet where they wouldn't mind his talking like that, they suddenly picked up a computer-driven distress call and diverted to investigate. A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the Merida class seemed to be dancing a strange little jig through the void. A brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer was fine, but that its pilot was mad. "'Half mad, half mad,' the man insisted as they carried him raving aboard. He was a journalist with the Sidereal Daily Mentioner. They sedated him and sent Marvin in to keep him company until he promised to try and talk sense. "'I was covering a trial,' he said at last, "'on Agerbuthon.' He pushed himself up onto his thin and wasted shoulders. His eyes stared wildly. His white hair seemed to be waving at someone at new in the next room. "'Easy, easy,' said Ford. Trillian put a soothing hand on his shoulder. The man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the ship's sick bay. "'The case,' he said, "'is now immaterial. But there was a witness—a witness—a man called—' "'Prac. A strange and difficult man. They were eventually forced to administer a drug to make him tell the truth—a truth drug.' His eyes rolled helplessly in his head. "'They gave him too much,' he said in a tiny whimper. "'They gave him much too much,' he started to cry. "'I think the robots must have jogged the surgeon's arm.' "'Robots?' asked Safer sharply. "'What robots?' "'Some white robots,' whispered the man hoarsely. "'Broke into the courtroom and stole the judge's sceptre—the Agerbuthon Sceptre of Justice—the ussy plastic thing. I don't know why they wanted it.' He began to cry again. "'I think they jogged the surgeon's arm.' He shook his head loosely from side to side helplessly. Sadly his eyes screwed up in pain. "'And when the trial continued,' he said in a weeping whisper, "'they asked Prac a most unfortunate thing. They asked him—' he paused and shivered—'to tell the truth—the whole truth—and nothing but the truth—only—don't you see?' He suddenly hoisted himself up onto his elbows again and shouted at them. "'They'd given him too much of the drug!' He collapsed again, moaning quietly. "'Much too much, too much, too much, too much!' The group gathered round his bedside, glanced at one another. There were goose-bumps on backs. "'What happened?' said Zafot at last. "'Oh, he told it all right,' said the man savagely. "'For all I know he's still telling it now. Strange, terrible things. Terrible, terrible!' He screamed. They tried to calm him, but he struggled to his elbows again. "'Terrible things! Incomprehensible things!' he shouted. "'Things that would drive a man mad!' He stared wildly at them. "'Or in my case,' he said, "'half mad. I'm a journalist.' "'You mean,' said Arthur quietly, "'that you're used to confronting the truth?' "'No,' said the man with the puzzled frown. "'I mean that I made an excuse and left early.' He collapsed into a coma, from which he recovered only once and briefly. On that one occasion they discovered from him the following. When it became clear what was happening, and as it became clear that Prack could not be stopped, that here was truth in its absolute and final form, the court was cleared. Not only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prack still in it. Steel walls were erected around it, and just to be on the safe side barbed wire, electric fences, crocodile swamps, and three major armies were installed, so that no one would ever have to hear Prack speak. "'That's a pity,' said Arthur. "'I'd quite like to hear what he has to say. Presumably he would know what the answer to the ultimate question is. It has always bothered me that we never found out.' "'Think of a number,' said the computer. "'Any number.' Arthur told the computer the telephone number of King's Cross Railway Station Passenger Inquiries, on the grounds that it must have some function, and this might turn out to be it. The computer injected the number into the ship's reconstituted Improbability Drive. In Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and Space tells Matter how to move. The Heart of Gold told Space to get knotted, and parch itself neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the Argibuthon Chamber of Law. The courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber, clearly designed for justice rather than, for instance, pleasure. You wouldn't hold a dinner-party there, at least not a successful one. The decor would get your guests down. The ceilings were high, vaulted, and very dark. Shadows lurked there with grim determination. The panelling for the walls and benches, the cladding of the heavy pillars, all were carved from the darkest and most severe trees in the fearsome forest of Argylbard. The massive black podium of justice which dominated the centre of the chamber was a monster of gravity. If a sunbeam had ever managed to slink this far into the justice complex of Argibuthon, it would have turned around and slunk straight back out again. Arthur and Trillian were the first in, while Ford and Zaphod bravely kept a watch on their rear. At first it seemed totally dark and deserted. Their footsteps echoed hollowly round the chamber. This seemed curious. All the defences were still in position and operative around the outside of the building. They had run scan-checks. Therefore, they had assumed, the truth-telling must still be going on. But there was nothing. Then, as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they spotted a dull red glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live shadow. They swung a flashlight round on to it. Prack was sitting on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette. "'Ah, hi,' he said, with a little half-wave. His voice echoed through the chamber. He was a little man, with scraggy hair. He sat with his shoulders hunched forward, and his head and knees kept jiggling. He took a drag of his cigarette. They stared at him. "'What's going on?' said Trillian. "'Nothing,' said the man, and jiggled his shoulders. Arthur shone his flashlight full on Prack's face. "'We thought,' he said, "'that you were meant to be telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.' "'Oh, that!' said Prack. "'Yeah. I was. I finished. There's not nearly as much of it as people imagine. Some of it's pretty funny, though.' He suddenly exploded into about three seconds of maniacal laughter, and stopped again. He sat there, jiggling his head and knees. He dragged on his cigarette with a strange half-smile. Ford and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows. "'Tell us about it,' said Ford. "'Oh, I can't remember any of it now,' said Prack. "'I thought of writing some of it down, but at first I couldn't find a pencil, and then I thought, oh, why bother?' There was a long silence, during which they thought they could feel the universe age a little. Prack stared into the light. "'None of it,' said Arthur at last. "'You can remember none of it?' "'Oh, no. Except most of the good bits were about frogs. I remember that.' Suddenly he was hooting with laughter again, and stamping his feet on the ground. "'You would not believe some of the things about frogs!' he gasped. "'Come on, let's go and find ourselves a frog. Boy, will I ever see them in a new light!' He leapt to his feet and did a tiny little dance. Then he stopped and took a long drag at his cigarette. "'Let's find a frog I can laugh at,' he said simply. "'Anyway, who are you guys?' "'We came to find you,' said Trillian, deliberately not keeping the disappointment out of her voice. "'My name is Trillian.' Prack jiggled his head. "'Ford Prefect,' said Ford Prefect with a shrug. Prack jiggled his head. "'And I,' said Zayford when he judged that the silence was once again deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be tossed in lightly, "'am Zayford Beeblerocks.' Prack jiggled his head. "'Who's this guy?' said Prack, jiggling his shoulder at Arthur, who was standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts. "'Me,' said Arthur. "'Oh, my name's Arthur Dent.' Prack's eyes popped out of his head. "'No kidding!' he yelled. "'You are Arthur Dent! The Arthur Dent!' He staggered backward, clutching his stomach convulsed with fresh paroxysms of laughter. "'Hey, just think of meeting you!' he gasped. "'Boy!' he shouted. "'You are the most—wow! You just leave the frog standing!' He howled and screamed with laughter. He fell over backwards onto the bench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with laughter, kicked his head in the air. He beat his chest. Gradually he subsided, panting. He looked at them. He looked at Arthur. He fell back again, howling with laughter. Eventually he fell asleep. Arthur stood there, with his lips twitching, while the others carried Prack comatose onto the ship. "'Before we picked up Prack,' said Arthur, "'I was going to leave. "'I still want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible.' The others nodded in silence, a silence only slightly undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical laughter that came drifting from Prack's cabin at the farthest end of the ship. "'We have questioned him,' continued Arthur, "'or at least you have questioned him. "'I, as you know, can't go near him on everything, "'and he doesn't really seem to have anything to contribute, "'just the occasional snippet and things I don't wish to hear about frogs.' The others tried not to smirk. "'Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke,' said Arthur, and then had to wait for the others to stop laughing. "'I am the first—' He stopped again. This time he stopped and listened to the silence. There actually was silence this time, and it had come very suddenly. Prack was quiet. For days they had lived with constant, maniacal laughter ringing round the ship, only occasionally relieved by short periods of light giggling and sleep. Arthur's very souls clenched with paranoia. This was not the silence of sleep. A buzzer sounded. A glance at a board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prack. "'He's not well,' said Trillian quietly. "'The constant laughing is completely wrecking his body.' Arthur's lips twitched, but he said nothing. "'We'd better go and see him,' said Trillian. Trillian came out of the cabin, wearing her serious face. "'He wants you to go in,' she said to Arthur, who was wearing his glum and tight-lipped one. He thrust his hands deep into his dressing-gown pockets and tried to think of something to say which wouldn't sound petty. It seemed terribly unfair, but he couldn't. "'Please,' said Trillian. He shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight-lipped face with him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prack. He looked down at his tormentor, who was lying quietly on the bed, ashen and wasted. His breathing was very shallow. Ford and Zaphod were standing by the bed, looking awkward. "'You wanted to ask me something,' said Prack in a thin voice and coughed slightly. Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided. "'How do you know that?' he asked. Prack shrugged weakly. "'Because it's true,' he said simply. Arthur took the point. "'Yes,' he said at last, in a rather strange drawl. "'I did have a question, or rather what I actually have is an answer. I wanted to know what the question was.' Prack nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little. "'It's—well, it's a long story,' he said, "'but the question I would like to know is the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything. All we know about it is that the answer is 42, which is a little aggravating.' Prack nodded again. "'Forty-two,' he said. "'Ah, yeah, that's right.' He paused. Shadows of thought and memory crossed his face, like the shadows of clouds crossing the land. "'I'm afraid,' he said at last, "'that the question and the answer are mutually exclusive. Knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other. It's impossible that both can ever be known about the same universe.' He paused again. Disappointment crept into Arthur's face and snuggled down into its accustomed place. "'Except,' said Prack, struggling to sort a thought out, "'if it happened, it seems that the question and the answer would just cancel each other out and take the universe with them, which would then be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable. It's possible this has already happened.' He added with a weak smile, "'But there is a certain amount of uncertainty about it.' A light giggle brushed through him. Arthur sat down on a stool. "'Oh well,' he said with resignation. "'I was just hoping there would be some sort of reason.' "'Do you know,' said Prack, "'the story of the reason?' Arthur said that he didn't, and Prack said that he knew that he didn't. He told it. "'One night,' he said, "'a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet that had never seen one before. "'The planet was Dolphosus. "'The ship was this one, the Heart of Gold. "'It appeared as a brilliant new star moving silently across the heavens. "'Primitive tribesmen, who were sitting huddled on the cold hillsides, "'looked up from their steaming night-drinks and pointed with trembling fingers "'and swore that they had seen a sign, a sign from their gods, "'that meant that they must now arise at last and go and slay the evil princes of the plains. "'In the high turrets of their palaces, "'the princes of the plains looked up and saw the shining star, "'and received it unmistakably as a sign from their gods "'that they must go and attack the accursed tribesmen of the cold hillsides. "'And between them, the dwellers in the forest looked up into the sky "'and saw the sign of the new star, and saw it with fear and apprehension. "'Although they had never seen anything like it before, "'they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they bowed their heads in despair. "'They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign. "'When the rains departed, it was a sign. "'When the winds rose, it was a sign. "'When the winds fell, it was a sign. "'When in the land there was born at the midnight of a full moon "'a goat with three heads, that was a sign. "'When in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon "'a perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications, "'or even just a child with a retrusé nose, "'that too would often be taken as a sign. "'So there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky "'was a sign of a particularly spectacular order. "'And each new sign signified the same thing, "'that the princes of the plains and the tribesmen of the cold hillsides "'were about to beat the hell out of each other again. "'This in itself wouldn't be so bad, "'except that the princes of the plains and the tribesmen of the cold hillsides "'always elected to beat the hell out of each other in the forest. "'And it was always the dwellers in the forest "'who came off the worst in these exchanges, "'though as far as they could see, it had never had anything to do with them. "'And sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, "'the dwellers in the forest would send a messenger "'to either the leader of the princes of the plains "'or the leader of the tribesmen of the cold hillsides, "'and demand to know the reason for this intolerable behaviour. "'And the leader, whichever one it was, "'would take the messenger aside and explain the reason to him, "'slowly and carefully, and with great attention "'to the considerable detail involved. "'And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. "'It was very clear, very rational, and tough. "'The messenger would hang his head, and feel sad and foolish "'that he had not realised what a tough and complex place the real world was, "'and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be embraced "'if one was to live in it. "'Now do you understand?' the leader would say. "'The messenger would nod dumbly. "'And you see these battles have to take place.' "'Another dumb nod. "'And why they have to take place in the forest, "'and why it's in everybody's best interest, "'the forest dwellers included, that they should. "'Uh, in the long run, "'uh, yes.' "'And the messenger did understand the reason, "'and he returned to his people in the forest. "'But as he approached them, "'and as he walked through the forest and among the trees, "'he found that all he could remember of the reason "'was how terribly clear the argument had seemed. "'What it actually was, he couldn't remember at all. "'And this, of course, was a great comfort, "'when next the tribesmen and the princes "'came hacking and burning their way through the forest, "'killing every forest dweller in their way.' "'Prac paused in his story and coughed pathetically. "'I was the messenger,' he said, "'after the battles precipitated by the appearance of your ship, "'which were particularly savage. "'Many of our people died. "'I thought I could bring the reason back. "'I went and was told it by the leader of the princes, "'but on the way back it slipped and melted away in my mind "'like snow in the sun. "'That was many years ago, and much has happened since then.' "'He looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently.' "'There's one thing I can remember from the truth, Drug, "'apart from the frogs, "'and that is God's last message to his creation. "'Would you like to hear it?' "'For a moment they didn't know whether to take him seriously. "'It's true,' he said. "'For real. I mean it.' "'His chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath. "'His head lolled slightly. "'I wasn't very impressed with it when I first knew what it was,' he said. "'But now I think back to how impressed I was by the prince's reason "'and how soon afterwards I couldn't recall it at all. "'I think it might be a lot more helpful. "'Would you like to know what it is, would you?' "'They nodded dumbly. "'I bet you would. "'If you're that interested, I suggest you go and look for it. "'It is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire "'on top of the Quentulus Quasgar mountains "'in the land of Seville-by-Upstreet on the planet Prellium-Tarn, "'third out from the sun, Zars, "'in Galactic Sector QQ-7, Active J Gamma. "'It is guarded by the logistic Ventrachel of Lob.' "'There was a long silence following this announcement, "'which was finally broken by Arthur. "'Sorry, it's where?' he said. "'It is written,' repeated Prack, "'in thirty-foot-high letters of fire "'on top of the Quentulus Quasgar mountains "'in the land of Seville-by-Upstreet on the planet Prellium-Tarn, "'third out from the—' "'Sorry,' said Arthur, "'which mountains?' "'The Quentulus Quasgar mountains "'in the land of Seville-by-Upstreet on the planet—' "'Which land was that? I didn't quite catch it. "'Seville-by-Upstreet on the planet—' "'Seville-by-what?' "'Oh, for heaven's sake!' said Prack, and died testily." In the following days, Arthur thought a little about this message, but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of finding a nice little world somewhere where he could settle down and lead a quiet, retired life. Having saved the universe twice in one day, he thought that he could take things a little easier from now on. They dropped him off on the planet Cricket, which was now once again a pleasant, idyllic, pastoral world, even if the songs did occasionally get on his nerves. He spent a lot of time flying. He learnt to communicate with birds, and discovered that their conversation was fantastically boring. It was all to do with wind speed, wingspans, power-to-weight ratios, and a fair bit about berries. Unfortunately, he discovered, once you've learned bird-speak, you quickly come to realise that the air is full of it the whole time, just inane bird-chatter. There is no getting away from it. For that reason, Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live on the ground and love it, despite the inane chatter he had down there as well. One day he was walking through the fields, humming a ravishing tune he'd heard recently, when a silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in front of him. A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall, grey-green alien marched out and approached him. "'Arthur Phili—' it said, then glanced sharply at him and down at his clipboard. It frowned. It looked up at him again. "'I've done you before, haven't I?' it said."
 Chapter 2 This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant, as he emerged from the cave he called home, until he could think of a better name for it, or find a better cave. Though his throat was sore again from his early-morning yell of horror, he was suddenly in a terrific good mood. He wrapped his dilapidated dressing-gown tightly around him, and beamed the bright morning. The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirping at each other, the birds were flitting about prettily, and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could. It wasn't all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel so cheery, though. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futileness and futility of his life here on prehistoric earth, which was that he would go mad. He beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit-leg left over from his supper. He chewed happily for a few moments and then decided formally to announce his decision. He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills. To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit-bone in his beard. He spread his arms out wide. "'I will go mad,' he announced. "'Good idea,' said Ford Prefett, clambering down from a rock on which he had been sitting. Arthur's brain somersaulted. His jaw did press-ups. "'I went mad for a while,' said Ford. "'Did me no end of good.' Arthur's eyes did cartwheels. "'You see,' said Ford. "'Where have you been?' interrupted Arthur, now that his head had finished working out. "'Oh, around,' said Ford. "'Round and about.' He grinned in what he accurately judged to be an infuriating manner. "'I just took my mind off the hook for a bit. I reckoned that if the world wanted me badly enough it would call back. It did.' He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his sub-ether sensomatic. "'At least,' he said, "'I think it did. This has been playing up a bit.' He shook it. "'If it was a false alarm I shall go mad,' he said, again. Arthur shook his head and sat down. He looked up. "'I thought you must be dead,' he said simply. "'So did I for a while,' said Ford. "'And then I decided that I was a lemon for a couple of weeks. I kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of a gin and tonic.' Arthur cleared his throat, then did it again. "'Where,' he said, "'did you find a gin and tonic?' said Arthur brightly. "'I found a small lake that thought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that. At least I think it thought it was a gin and tonic. "'I may,' he added with a grin which would have sent sane men scampering into trees, have been imagining it." He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than that. "'Carry on,' he said evenly. "'The point is,' he said, said Ford, "'that there is no point in trying to drive yourself mad, trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well give in and save your sanity for later.' "'And this is you sane again, is it?' said Arthur. "'I ask merely for information.' "'I went to Africa,' said Ford. "'Yes? Yes.' "'What was that like?' "'And this is your cave, is it?' said Ford. "'Yes,' said Arthur. He felt very strange. After nearly four years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he could almost cry. Ford was, on the other hand, an almost immediately annoying person. "'Very nice,' said Ford in reference to Arthur's cave. ''You must hate it.' Arthur didn't bother to reply. "'Africa was very interesting,' said Ford. "'I behaved very oddly there.' He gazed thoughtfully into the distance. "'I took up being cruel to animals,' he said airily, but only, he added, as a hobby. "'Oh, yes?' said Arthur warily. "'Oh, yes,' Ford assured him. "'I won't disturb you with the details, because they would—' "'What?' "'Disturb you. But you may be interested to know that I am single-handedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe, and I try to learn to fly. Do you believe me?' "'Tell me,' said Arthur. "'I'll tell you later. I'll just mention that the Guide says—' "'The—' "'The Guide. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?' "'Yes. I remember throwing it into the river.' "'Yes,' said Ford, but I fished it out again. "'You didn't tell me. I didn't want you to throw it in again.' "'Fair enough,' admitted Arthur. It says—' "'What?' "'The Guide says—' "'The Guide says that there is an art to flying,' said Ford. Or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.' He smiled weakly. He pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were all torn and worn through. "'I haven't done very well so far,' he said. He stuck out his hand. "'I'm very glad to see you again, Arthur,' he added. Arthur shook his head in a sudden excess of emotion and bewilderment. "'I haven't seen anyone for years,' he said. "'Not anyone. I can hardly even remember how to speak. I keep forgetting words. I practice, you see. I practice by talking to—' "'Talking to—oh, no. What are those things people think you're mad if you talk to? Like George III?' "'Kings,' suggested Ford. "'No, no, no,' said Arthur. "'The things he used to talk to. We're surrounded by them, for heaven's sake. I've planted hundreds myself. They all died. Trees. I practice by talking to trees. What's that for?' Ford still had his hand stuck out. Arthur looked at it with incomprehension. "'Shake,' prompted Ford. Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to be a fish. Then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming flood of relief. He shook it and shook it. After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. He climbed to the top of a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around them. "'What happened to the Golga Frinchams?' said Ford. Arthur shrugged. "'A lot of them didn't make it through the winter three years ago,' he said. "'And the few who remained in the spring said they needed a holiday and set off on a raft. History says they must have survived.' "'Huh,' said Ford. "'Well, well.' He stuck his hands on his hips and looked around again at the empty world. Suddenly there was about Ford a sense of energy and purpose. "'We're going,' he said, excitedly and shivered with energy. "'Where? How?' said Arthur. "'I don't know,' said Ford, 'but I just feel that the time is right. Things are going to happen. We're on our way.' He lowered his voice to a whisper. "'I have detected,' he said, "'disturbances in the wash.' He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off. Arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said, because he hadn't quite taken his meaning. Ford repeated it. "'The wash?' said Arthur. "'The space-time wash,' said Ford, and as the wind blew briefly past at that moment he bared his teeth into it. Arthur nodded and then cleared his throat. "'Are we talking about,' he asked cautiously, "'some sort of Vaughan laundromat, or what are we talking about?' "'Eddie's,' said Ford. "'In the space-time continuum.' "'Ah!' nodded Arthur. "'Is he? Is he?' He pushed his hands into the pocket of his dressing-gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance. "'What?' said Ford. "'Er, who,' said Arthur. "'Is Eddie, then, exactly, then?' Ford looked angrily at him. "'Will you listen?' he snapped. "'I have been listening,' said Arthur, "'but I'm not sure it's helped.' Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing-gown and spoke to him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody from a telephone company accounts department. "'There seem,' he said, "'to be some pools,' he said, "'of instability,' he said, ''in the fabric,' he said.' Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing-gown where Ford was holding it. Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the foolish look into a foolish remark. "'In the fabric of space-time,' he said. "'Ah, that!' said Arthur. "'Yes, that,' confirmed Ford. They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric earth and stared each other resolutely in the face. "'And it's done what?' said Arthur. "'It,' said Ford, "'has developed pools of instability.' "'Has it?' said Arthur, his eye not wavering for a moment. "'It has,' said Ford, with a similar degree of ocular immobility. "'Good,' said Arthur. "'See?' said Ford. "'No,' said Arthur." There was a quiet pause. "'The difficulty with this conversation,' said Arthur, after a sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, is that it's very different from most of the ones I've had of late, which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees. They weren't like this, except perhaps some of the ones I've had with elms, which sometimes got a bit bogged down. "'Arthur,' said Ford. "'Hello? Yes?' said Arthur. "'Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very, very simple.' "'Ah, well, I'm not sure I believe that.' The others sat down and composed their thoughts. Ford got out his Sabita Sensomatic. It was making vague humming noises, and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly. "'Flat battery?' said Arthur. "'No,' said Ford. "'There is a moving disturbance in the fabric of space-time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it's somewhere in our vicinity.' "'Where?' Ford moved the device in a slow, lightly bobbing semicircle. Suddenly the light flashed. "'There!' said Ford, shooting out his arm. "'There, behind that sofa!' Arthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet, paisley-covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them. He boggled intelligently at it. Shrewd questions sprang into his mind. "'Why,' he said, "'is there a sofa in that field?' "'I told you!' shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. "'The eddy is in the space-time continuum!' "'And this is his sofa, is it?' asked Arthur, struggling to his feet, and he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses. "'Arthur!' shouted Ford at him. "'That sofa is there because of the space-time instability I've been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to grips with. It's been washed up out of the continuum. It's space-time jetson. It doesn't matter what it is, we've got to catch it. It's our only way out of here.' He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across the field. "'Catch it!' muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass. With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture. They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way. The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake. Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided that he would go mad, and now here he was already chasing a chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric earth. The sofa bobbed this way and that, and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees, as it drifted past some of them, and hazy as a billowing dream, as it floated like a ghost through others. Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and weaved, as if following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was. Still they pursued it, still it danced and span, and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrophe-graph, and they were practically on top of it. With a heave and a shout they leapt on it. The sun winked out and they fell through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at Lord's Cricket Ground, St John's Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test match of the Australian Series in the year 1980-something, with England needing only twenty-eight runs to win.
 36. The flying saucer in which Ford Prefect had stowed away had stunned the world. Finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no hallucinations, no mysterious CIA agents found floating in reservoirs. This time it was real, it was definite, it was definitely definite. It had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath it, and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate in the world, including much of Harrods. The thing was massive, nearly a mile across, some said, dull silver in colour, pitted, scorched, and disfigured with the scars of unnumbered vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns unknown to man. A hatchway opened, crashed down through the Harrods' food halls, demolished Harvey Nichols, and with a final grinding scream of tortured architecture toppled the Sheraton Park Tower. After a long, heart-stopping moment of internal crashes and grumbles of rending machinery, there marched from it down the ramp an immense silver robot, a hundred feet tall. It held up a hand. "'I come in peace,' it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, "'Take me to your lizard!'' Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat with Arthur, and watched the non-stop frenetic news reports on the television, none of which had anything to say other than to record that the thing had done this amount of damage, which was valued at that amount of billions of pounds, and had killed this totally other number of people, and then say it again, because the robot was doing nothing more than standing there, swaying very slightly, and emitting short, incomprehensible error messages. "'It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see,' said Ford. "'You mean it comes from a world of lizards?' "'No,' said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him. "'Nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world the people are people, the leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards, and the lizards rule the people.' "'Odd,' said Arthur. "'I thought you said it was a democracy?' "'I did,' said Ford. "'It is.' "'So,' said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, "'why don't the people get rid of the lizards?' "'It honestly doesn't occur to them,' said Ford. "'They've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.' "'You mean they actually vote for the lizards?' "'Oh, yes,' said Ford, with a shrug. "'Of course.' "'But,' said Arthur, going for the big one again, "'why?' "'Because if they didn't vote for a lizard,' said Ford, "'the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?' "'What?' "'I said,' said Ford, in an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, "'have you got any gin?' "'I'll look. Tell me about the lizards.' Ford shrugged again. "'Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,' he said. "'They're completely wrong, of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it.' "'But that's terrible,' said Arthur. "'Listen, Bud,' said Ford, "'if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the universe look at another bit of the universe and say, "'That's terrible,' I wouldn't be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin. But I haven't, and I am. Anyway, what are you looking so placid and moon-eyed for? Are you in love?' Arthur said, "'Yes, he was,' and said it placidly. "'With someone who knows where the gin bottle is, do I get to meet her?' He did, because Fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of newspapers she had been to the village to buy. She stopped in astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from Beetlejuice on the sofa. "'Where's the gin?' said Ford to Fenchurch, and to Arthur. "'What happened to Trillian, by the way?' "'This is Fenchurch,' said Arthur, awkwardly. "'There was nothing with Trillian. You must have seen her last.' "'Oh, yes,' said Ford. "'She went off with Zaphod somewhere. They had some kids or something. At least,' he added, "'I think that's what they were. Zaphod's calmed down a lot, you know.' "'Really?' said Arthur, clustering hurriedly around Fenchurch to relieve her of the shopping. "'Yes,' said Ford, "'at least one of his heads is now saner than an emu on acid.' "'Arthur, who is this?' said Fenchurch. "'Ford Prefect,' said Arthur. I may have mentioned him in passing."
 Chapter XXV. Even as the starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on the top of a small cliff on the mile-wide asteroid that pursued a lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star system of Cricket, its crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event. They didn't realise they were going to see two. They stood cold, lonely, and helpless on the cliff edge and watched the activity below. Lances of light wheeled in sinister arcs against the void from a point only about a hundred yards below and in front of them. They stared into the blinding event. An extension of the ship's field enabled them to stand there by once again exploiting the mind's predisposition to have tricks played on it. The problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid or of not being able to breathe simply became somebody else's. The white Cricket warship was parked among the stark grey crags of the asteroid, alternately flaring under arc-lights or disappearing in shadow. The black shadows cast by the hard rocks danced together in wild choreography as the arc-lights swept around them. The eleven white robots were bearing in procession the Wicked Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights. The Wicked Key had been rebuilt. Its components shone and glittered. The Steel Pillar, or Marvin's leg, of strength and power. The Golden Bale, or heart of the infinite and probability drive, of prosperity. The Perspex Pillar, or Agarbuthon's scepter of justice, of science and reason. The Silver Bale, or Rory Award, for the most gratuitous use of the word fuck in a serious screenplay. And the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar, or ashes of a burnt stump signifying the death of English cricket, of nature and spirituality. "'I suppose there is nothing we can do at this point?' asked Arthur nervously. "'No,' sighed Slotty Bartfast. The expression of disappointment that crossed Arthur's face was a complete failure, and since he was standing obscured by shadow he allowed it to collapse into one of relief. "'A pity,' he said. "'We have no weapons,' said Slotty Bartfast. "'Stupidly.' "'A damn,' said Arthur very quietly. Ford said nothing. Trillian said nothing, but in a peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way. She was staring at that blankness of the space beyond the asteroid. The asteroid circled the dust-cloud that surrounded the slow time envelope that enclosed the world on which lived the people of cricket, the masters of cricket and their killer robots. The helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the cricket robots were aware of their presence. They could only assume that they must be, but they felt, quite rightly in the circumstances, that they had nothing to fear. They had an historic task to perform, and their audience could be regarded with contempt. "'Terribly impotent feeling, isn't it?' said Arthur, but the others ignored him. In the centre of the area of light that the robots were approaching, a square-shaped crack appeared in the ground. The crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became clear that a block of the ground, about six feet square, was slowly rising. At the same time they became aware of some other movement, but it was also subliminal, and for a moment or two it was not clear what it was that was moving. Then it became clear. The asteroid was moving. It was moving in toward the dust-cloud, as if being hauled inexorably by some celestial angler in its depths. They were to make in real life the journey through the cloud that they had already made in the room of informational illusions. They stood frozen in silence. Trillian frowned. An age seemed to pass. Events seemed to pass with spinning slowness, as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the vague and soft outer perimeter of the cloud. And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity. They passed on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and walls, indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of the eye. The dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light. The shafts of brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of dust. Trillian again regarded the passage from within her own frowning thoughts. And they were through it. Whether it had taken a minute or half an hour, they weren't sure, but they were through it and confronted with a fresh blankness, as if space were pinched out of existence in front of them. And now things moved quickly. A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the block that had risen three feet out of the ground, and out of that rose a smaller perspex block, dazzling with interior dancing colours. The block was slotted with deep grooves, three upright and two across, clearly designed to accept the wicket key. The robots approached the lock, slotted the key into its home, and stepped back again. The block twisted around of its own accord, and space began to alter. As space unpinched itself, it seemed agonisingly to twist the eyes of the watchers in their sockets. They found themselves staring, blinded, at an unravelled sun that stood now before them, where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space. It was a second or two before they were even sufficiently aware of what had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified, blinded eyes. In that second or two they were aware of a tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that sun. They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison, Cricket! Cricket! Cricket! Cricket! The sound chilled them. It was harsh. It was cold. It was empty. It was mechanically dismal. It was also triumphant. They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost missed the second historic event. Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to survive a direct blast attack from the cricket robots, ran out of the cricket warship, brandishing a zap gun. OK, he cried, the situation is totally under control as of this moment in time. The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung his battle-club and connected it with the back of Zaphod's left head. Who the zark did that? said his left head, and lolled sickeningly forward. His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance. Who did what? it said. The club connected with the back of his right head. It measured his length and rather strange shape on the ground. Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over. A few blasts from the robot were sufficient to destroy the lock for ever. It split and melted, and splayed its contents brokenly, and the robots marched grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened manner back into their warship, which with a thoop was gone. William and Ford ran hectically around and down the steep incline to the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 Chapter 2 Like all Vogon ships, it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protruded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses. In fact, to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you have to go inside it and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing, because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish that you had never been born, or, if you are a clearer-minded thinker, that the Vogon had never been born. In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn't even think once. They are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced, and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very angry. One thing they don't like is leaving a job unfinished, particularly this Vogon, and particularly, for various reasons, this job. This Vogon was Captain Prosthetic Vogon Jelts of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he it was who had the job of demolishing the so-called planet Earth. He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill-fitting, slimy seat, and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned. It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its infinite improbability drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built. Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him, and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well. It mattered even less to him that Zephod Beeblebrox was aboard. Zephod Beeblebrox was now the ex-President of the Galaxy, and though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both him and the ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested. He had other fish to fry. It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption, in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this is certainly true in his case. When he heard the words Integrity or Moral Rectitude, he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of Ready Money in large quantities, he reached for the rule-book and threw it away. In seeking so implacably the destruction of the earth and all that therein lay, he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been glossed over. He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction. �Computer,� he croaked, �get me my brain-care specialist on the line.� Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfront appeared on the screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light-years away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony, too. Though the Vogon persistently referred to him as �my private brain-care specialist�, there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfront who was employing the Vogon. He was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of the Galaxy�s most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake. �Well,� he said, �hello, my captain of Vogon�s prosthetic, and how are we feeling today?� The Vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise. Halfront�s smile did not flicker for an instant. �Well,� he said, �I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a Vogon, you know, the natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence.� �That,� rumbled the Vogon, �is what you always say.� �Well, again,� said Halfront, �I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good! We are clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me, what news of the mission?� �We have located the ship.� �Wonderful!� said Halfront. �Wonderful! And the occupants?� �The Earthman is there.� �Excellent! And� �A female from the same planet. They are the last.� �Good! Good!� beamed Halfront. �Who else?� �The man-prefect.� �Yes.� �And Zephod Beeblebrox.� For an instant Halfront�s smile flickered. �Ah, yes,� he said, �I had been expecting this. It is most regrettable.� �A personal friend?� inquired the Vogon, who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out. �Ah, no,� said Halfront, �in my profession, you know, we do not make personal friends.� �Ah,� grunted the Vogon, �professional detachment.� �No,� said Halfront cheerfully, �we just don't have the knack.� He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned slightly. �But Beeblebrox, you know,� he said, �he is one of my most profitable clients. He has personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts.� He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it. �Still,� he said, �you are ready for your task?� �Yes.� �Good. Destroy the ship immediately.� �What about Beeblebrox?� �Well,� said Halfront brightly, �Zephod is just his guy, you know.� He vanished from the screen. The Vogon captain pressed a communicator button, which connected him with the remains of his crew. �Attack!� he said. At that precise moment Zephod Beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly. Two hours ago he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the restaurant at the end of the universe, whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship's computer, and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the improbability factors with a pencil. The heart of Gold's improbability drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen. He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching it. He didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it. He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except that it seemed a fun thing to be. He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that they were buried in a dark, locked-off section of his two brains. He wished the dark, locked-off section of his two brains would go away, because they occasionally surfaced momentarily, and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind, and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time. At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had run out of patience and pencils, and was feeling very hungry. "'Starbucks!' he shouted. At that precise moment Ford Prefect was in mid-air. This was not because of anything wrong with the ship's artificial gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stairwell which led to the ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump to do in one bound, and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod's door, and explained what was on his mind. "'Vogons!' he said. A short while before this Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism, because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was called a Nutrimatic Drink Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before. It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid which was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. He attempted to reason with the thing. "'Tea!' he said. "'Share and enjoy,' the machine replied, and provided him with yet another cup of the sickly liquid. He threw it away. "'Share and enjoy,' the machine repeated, and produced another one. Share and enjoy is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints Division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium-sized planets, and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years. The motto stands, or rather stood, in three-mile-high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department's spaceport on Edrax. Unfortunately, its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in, and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives, now deceased. The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear in the local language to read, "'Go stick your head in a pig,' and are no longer illuminated except at times of special celebration." Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid. "'Listen, you machine,' he said, "'you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff?' "'Nutrition and pleasurable sense-data,' burbled the machine. "'Share and enjoy.' "'It tastes filthy.' "'If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink,' continued the machine, "'why not share it with your friends?' "'Because,' said Arthur tartly, "'I want to keep them. Will you try to comprehend what I'm telling you? That drink--' "'That drink,' said the machine sweetly, "'was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure.' "'Ah!' said Arthur, "'so I'm a masochist on a diet, am I?' "'Share and enjoy.' "'Oh, shut up!' "'Will that be all?' Arthur decided to give up. "'Yes,' he said. Then he decided he'd be damned if he'd give up. "'No,' he said. "'Look, it's very, very simple. All I want is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen.' And he sat. He told the Nutrimatic about India. He told it about China. He told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even told it briefly about the history of the East India Company. "'So that's it, is it?' said the Nutrimatic when he had finished. "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'That is what I want.' "'You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?' "'Ah, yes, with milk.' "'Squirt it out of a cow?' "'Well, in a manner of speaking, I suppose.' "'I'm going to need some help with this one,' said the machine tersely. All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business. "'Well, anything I can do?' said Arthur. "'You've done quite enough,' the Nutrimatic informed him. "'It's summoned the ship's computer.' "'Hi there,' said the ship's computer. The Nutrimatic explained about tea to the ship's computer. The computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutrimatic, and together they lapsed into a grim silence. Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further happened. He thumped it, but still nothing happened. Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge. In the empty wastes of space the Heart of Gold hung still. Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the galaxy. Towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.
 38. Crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft, which wasn't very. The immediate perimeter was fenced off and patrolled by the tiny flying service-robots. Staked out around that was the Army, who had been completely unable to breach that inner perimeter, but were damned if anybody was going to breach them. They, in turn, were surrounded by a cordon of police, though whether they were there to protect the public from the Army, or the Army from the public, or to guarantee the giant ship's diplomatic immunity and prevent it getting parking tickets, was entirely unclear and the subject of much debate. The inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled. The Army stirred uncomfortably, uncertain of how to react to the fact that the reason for their being there seemed as if it were simply going to get up and go. The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and now it was five o'clock in the afternoon, and no further sign had been seen of it. Much had been heard—more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions—but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed. This wonderful, extraordinary thing had come into their lives, and now was simply going to go without them. Two people were particularly aware of this sensation. Arthur and Fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find Ford Prefect in it anywhere, or any sign that he had the slightest intention of being there. "'How reliable is he?' asked Fenchurch, in a sinking voice. "'How reliable?' said Arthur. He gave a hollow laugh. "'How shallow is the ocean?' he said. "'How cold is the sun?' The last parts of the robot's gantry transport were being carried on board, and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were now stacked at the bottom of the ramp, waiting to follow them. The soldiers on guard around the ramp bristled meaningfully. Orders were barked back and forth. Hurried conferences were held, but nothing, of course, could be done about any of it. Hopelessly and with no clear plan now, Arthur and Fenchurch pushed Ford through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was also trying to push Ford through the crowd, this got them nowhere. And within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship. Every last link of the fence was aboard. A few flying fret-saws on the spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site, and then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves. A few seconds passed. The sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity, and slowly, heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of the Harrods' food-halls. The sound that accompanied it was the sound of thousands of tense, excited people being completely ignored. "'Hold it!' a megaphone barked from a taxi, which screeched to a halt on the edge of the milling crowd. "'There has been,' barked the megaphone, "'a major scientific break-in. Through! Break through!' It corrected itself. The door flew open, and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of Beetlejuice leapt out wearing a white coat. "'Hold it!' he shouted again, and this time brandished a short, squat, black rod with lights on it. The lights winked briefly. The ramp paused in its ascent, and then, in obedience to the signals from the thumb, which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming, while the other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals, slowly ground its way downwards again. Ford Prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and started bawling at the crowd through it. "'Make way!' he shouted. "'Make way! Please! This is a major scientific break-through! You and you, get the equipment from the taxi!' Completely at random, he pointed at Arthur and Fenchurch, who wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently round the taxi. "'All right! I want you to clear a passage, please, for some important pieces of scientific equipment!' boomed Ford. "'Just everybody keep calm! It's all under control. There's nothing to see. It is merely a major scientific breakthrough. Keep calm now. Important scientific equipment. Clear the way!' Hungry for new excitement, delighted at the sudden reprieve from disappointment, the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to open up. Arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi. "'Hang a coat over them,' he muttered to Fenchurch as he heaved them out to her. Hurriedly, he manoeuvred out the large supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat. It clattered to the ground, and together they loaded the boxes into it. "'Clear a path, please!' shouted Ford again. "'Everything's under proper scientific control!' "'He said you'd pay,' said the taxi-driver to Arthur, who dug out some notes and paid him. There was the distant sound of police sirens. "'Move along there!' shouted Ford. "'And no one will get hurt!' The crowd surged and closed behind them again, as frantically they pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through the rubble towards the ramp. "'It's all right!' Ford continued to bellow. "'There is nothing to see! It's all over! None of this is actually happening!' "'Clear the way, please!' boomed a police megaphone from the back of the crowd. "'There's been a break-in! Clear the way!' "'Break through!' yelled Ford in competition. "'A scientific break-through!' This is the police. Clear the way. "'Scientific equipment! Clear the way!' Police. Let us through.' "'Walkman!' yelled Ford, and pulled half a dozen miniature tape-players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd. The resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp and to haul it up onto the lip of it. "'Hold tight!' muttered Ford, and released a button on his electronic thumb. Beneath them the huge ramp juddered and began slowly to heave its way upwards. "'Okay, kids!' he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath them, and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp into the bowels of the ship. "'Looks like we're on our way!'
 Chapter 5. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a powerful organ. Indeed, its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had to be drawn up by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse. So none of its field researchers are allowed to accept any kind of services, discounts, or preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favours, unless a. they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the normal way, b. their lives would otherwise be in danger, or c. they really want to. Since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a cut, Ford always preferred to muck about with the first two. He stepped out along the street, walking briskly. The air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling city air, full of excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music, and the distant sound of warring police tribes. He carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion, so that he could get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without asking. It contained everything he owned, which at the moment wasn't much. A limousine careered down the street, dodging between the piles of burning garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which lurched screeching out of its way, stumbled against the window of a herbal remedies shop, set off a wailing alarm, blundered off down the street, and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small pasta restaurant where it knew it would get photographed and fed. Ford was walking north. He thought he was probably on his way to the Space Port, but he had thought that before. He knew he was going through that part of the city where people's plans often changed quite abruptly. "'Do you want to have a good time?' said a voice from the doorway. "'As far as I can tell,' said Ford, "'I'm having one, thanks.' "'Are you rich?' said another. This made Ford laugh. He turned and opened his arms in a wired gesture. "'Do I look rich?' he said. "'Don't know,' said the girl. "'Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you'll get rich. I have a very special service for rich people.' "'Oh, yes,' said Ford, intrigued but careful. "'And what's that?' "'I tell them it's OK to be rich.' Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, and bass players are to a penny in Hand Old City. Ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway. "'You what?' he said. The girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow. She was tall and had that kind of self-possessed shyness, which is a great trick if you can do it. "'It's my big number,' she said. "'I have a Master's degree in Social Economics, and can be very convincing. People love it, especially in this city.' "'Goosenag,' said Ford Prefect, which was a special Beetlejuice-ian word he used when he knew he should say something, but didn't know what it should be. He sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that old jank spirit and a towel. He opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with the towel, which had the opposite effect to the one intended, in that the old jank spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs that had been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of his towel. "'Want some?' he said, after he'd had a squeak himself. She shrugged and took the proffered bottle. They sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clamour of burglar alarms in the next block. "'As it happens, I'm owed a lot of money,' said Ford. "'So if I ever get hold of it, can I come back and see you then, maybe?' "'Sure, I'll be here,' said the girl. "'How much is a lot?' "'Fifteen years' back pay.' "'Four?' "'Writing two words.' "'Zarquans,' said the girl. Which one took the time?' "'Oh, the first one. Once I got that, the second one just came one afternoon after lunch.' A huge electronic drum-kit hurtled through the window high above them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them. It soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to lay an ambush for the other. Sounds of screaming sirens converged on the area, only to find themselves being picked off by copters which came flooding through the air between the city's mountainous tower-blocks. "'In fact,' said Ford, having to shout now above the din, "'it wasn't quite like that. I wrote an awful lot, but they just cut it down.' He took his copy of the guide back out of his satchel. "'Then the planet got demolished,' he shouted. "'Really worthwhile job, eh? They've still got to pay me, though.' "'You work for that thing?' The girl yelled back. "'Yeah. Good number.' "'You want to see the stuff I wrote?' he shouted. "'Before it gets erased. The new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net. Someone must have found out that the planet I spent fifteen years on has been demolished by now. They missed it on the last year revisions, but it can't escape their notice forever.' "'It's getting impossible to talk, isn't it?' said the girl. "'What?' she shrugged and pointed upwards. There was a copter above them now which seemed to be involved in a side-skirmish with the band upstairs. Smoke was billowing from the building. The sound engineer was hanging out of the window by his fingertips, and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers with a burning guitar. The helicopter was firing at all of them. "'Can we move?' They wandered down the street, away from the noise. They ran into a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them about the problems of the inner city, but then gave up and disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronised by the pack animal. All the time Ford was poking at the interface panel of the Guide. They ducked into an alleyway. Ford squatted in a garbage can while information began to flood over the screen of the Guide. He located his entry. "'Earth. Mostly harmless.' Almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages. "'Here it comes,' he said. "'Please wait,' said the messages. "'Entries are being updated over the sub-Ethernet. This entry is being revised. The system will be down for ten seconds.' At the end of the alley a steel-grey limousine crawled past. "'Hey, look,' said the girl. "'If you get paid, look me up. I'm a working girl and there are people over there who need me. I gotta go.' She brushed aside Ford's half-articulated protests and left him sitting dejectedly on his garbage can, preparing to watch a large swathe of his working life being swept away electronically into the Ether. Out in the streets things had calmed down a little. The police battle had moved off to other sectors of the city. The few surviving members of the rock band had agreed to recognise their musical differences and pursue solo careers. The street theatre group were re-emerging from the pasta restaurant with the pack animal, telling it they would like to take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little respect. And a little way further on the steel-grey limousine was parked silently by the kerbside. The girl hurried towards it. Behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow was bathing Ford Prefect's face and his eyes were slowly widening in astonishment. For where he had expected to find nothing, an erased, closed-off entry, there was instead a continuous stream of data—texts, diagrams, figures and images, moving descriptions of surf on Australian beaches, yoghurt on Greek islands, restaurants to avoid in Los Angeles, currency deals to avoid in Istanbul, weather to avoid in London, bars to go to everywhere—pages and pages of it. It was all there—everything he had written. With a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went backwards and forwards through it, stopping here and there at various entries. For instance, tips for aliens in New York. Find anywhere—Central Park, anywhere—no one will care or indeed even notice. Surviving. Get a job as a cab driver immediately. A cab driver's job is to drive people anywhere they want to go to in big yellow machines called taxis. Don't worry if you don't know how the machine works and you can't speak the language, don't understand the geography or indeed the basic physics of the area, and have large green antennae growing out of your head. Believe me, this is the best way of staying inconspicuous. If your body is really weird, try showing it to people in the streets for money. Amphibious life-forms from any of the worlds in these swallowing, noxious or nausea-lier systems will particularly enjoy the East River, which is said to be richer in those lovely life-giving nutrients than the finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet achieved. Having fun. This is the big section. It is impossible to have more fun without electrocuting your pleasure centres. Edward flipped the switch, which he saw was now marked MODE EXECUTE READY, instead of the now old-fashioned AXIS STANDBY, which had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone-aged OFF. This was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his own two eyes, or rather blinded as he had been by the hellish disruption of air and light, felt with his own two feet as the ground had started to pound at him like a hammer, bucking, roaring, gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow Vogon ships, and then at last, five seconds after the moment he determined as being the last possible moment had already passed, the gently swinging nausea of dematerialisation as he and Arthur Dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast. There was no mistake. There couldn't have been. The earth had definitely been destroyed. Definitely, definitely. Boiled away into space. And yet here—he activated the guide again—was his own entry on how he had set about having a good time in Bournemouth, Dorset, England, which he had always prided himself on as being one of the most Baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered. He read it again and shook his head in sheer wonder. Suddenly he realised what the answer to the problem was, and it was this, that something very weird was happening, and as something very weird was happening he thought he wanted it to be happening to him. He stashed the guide back in his satchel and hurried out onto the street again. Walking north again he passed a steel-grey limousine parked by the kerbside, and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying, It's OK, honey. It's really OK. You've got to learn to feel good about it. Look at the way the whole economy is structured. Ford grinned. Detoured round the next block, which was now in flames, found a police helicopter which was standing unattended in the street, broke into it, strapped himself in, crossed his fingers and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky. He weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city, and, once clear of them, hurtled through the black and red pall of smoke which hung permanently above it. Ten minutes later, with all the copter's sirens blazing and its rapid-fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds, Ford Prefect brought it careering down among the gantries and landing-lights at Handold Spaceport, where it settled like a gigantic, startled and very noisy gnat. Since he hadn't damaged it too much, he was able to trade it in for a first-class ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and settled into one of its huge, voluptuous, body-hugging seats. This is going to be fun, he thought to himself, as the ship blinked silently across the insane distances of deep space, and the cabin service got into its full extravagant swing. "'Yes, please,' he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided up to offer him anything at all. He smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again through the mysteriously reinstated entry on the planet earth. He had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able to attend to, and was terribly pleased that life had suddenly furnished him with a serious goal to achieve. It suddenly occurred to him to wonder where Arthur Dent was, and if he knew. Arthur Dent was 1,437 light-years away in a sarb, and anxious. Behind him in the back seat was a girl who had made him crack his head on the door as he climbed in. He didn't know if it was just because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid eyes on in years, or what it was, but he felt stupefied with—with—'This is absurd,' he told himself. 'Calm down,' he told himself. 'You are not,' he continued to himself, in the firmest internal voice he could muster, '-in a fit and rational state. You have just hitchhiked over a hundred thousand light-years across the galaxy. You are very tired, a little confused, and extremely vulnerable. Relax, don't panic, concentrate on breathing deeply.' He twisted round in his seat. "'Are you sure she is all right?' he said again. He found the fact that she was, to him, heart-thumpingly beautiful. He could make out very little how tall she was, how old she was, the exact shading of her hair, nor could he ask her anything about herself, because, sadly, she was completely unconscious. "'She's just drugged,' said her brother, shrugging, not moving his eye from the road ahead. "'And that's all right, is it?' said Arthur, in alarm. "'No, it suits me,' he said. "'Ah!' said Arthur. He added after a moment's thought. The conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly. After an initial flurry of opening hellos, he and Russell—the wonderful girl's brother's name was Russell, a name which to Arthur's mind always suggested burly men with blonde moustaches and blow-dried hair, who would at the slightest provocation start wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirt-fronts, and would then have to be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches—had quickly discovered that they didn't like each other. Russell was a burly man. He had a blonde moustache. His hair was fine and blow-dried. To be fair to him—though Arthur didn't see any necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it—he, Arthur, was looking pretty grim himself. A man can't cross a hundred thousand light-years, mostly in other people's baggage compartments, without beginning to fray a little, and Arthur had frayed a lot. "'She's not a junkie,' said Russell suddenly, as if he clearly thought that someone else in the car might be. "'She's under sedation.' "'But that's terrible,' said Arthur, twisting round to look at her again. She seemed to stir slightly, and her head slipped sideways on her shoulder. Her dark hair fell across her face, obscuring it. "'What's the matter with her? Is she ill?' "'No,' said Russell, merely barking mad. "'What?' said Arthur, horrified. "'Loopy! Completely bananas! I'm taking her back to the hospital and telling them to have another go. They let her out while she still thought she was a hedgehog.' "'A hedgehog!' Russell hoofed his horn fiercely at a car that came round the corner towards them, half-way on their side of the road, making them swerve. The anger seemed to make him feel better. "'Well, maybe not a hedgehog,' he said, after he'd settled down again, though it'd probably be simpler to deal with if she did. If somebody thinks they're a hedgehog, presumably you just give them a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves, come down again when they feel better. At least medical science could deal with it, that's the point. Seems that's not good enough for Fenny, though." "'Fenny?' "'You know what I got her for Christmas?' "'Well, no.' "'Black's Medical Dictionary.' "'Nice present.' "'I thought so. Thousands of diseases in it, all in alphabetical order.' "'You say her name is Fenny?' "'Yeah. Take your pick,' I said. "'Anything in here can be dealt with. The proper drugs can be prescribed. But no, she has to have something different, just to make life difficult. She was like that at school, you know.' "'Was she?' "'She was. Fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had ever heard of.' "'I can see how that would be irritating,' said Arthur doubtfully. He was rather disappointed to discover her name was Fenny. It was a rather silly, dispiriting name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt might vote herself if she couldn't sustain the name Fenella properly. "'Not that I wasn't sympathetic,' continued Russell, "'but it did get a bit irritating. She was limping for months.' He slowed down. "'This is your turning, isn't it?' "'Uh, no,' said Arthur. "'Five miles further on, if that's all right.' "'Okay,' said Russell, after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasn't, and speeded up again. "'It was, in fact, Arthur's turning, but he couldn't leave without finding out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a grip on his mind without even waking up. He could take either of the next two turnings.' They led back to the village that had been his home, though what he would find there he hesitated to imagine. Familiar landmarks had been flitting by, ghost-like in the dark, giving rise to the shudders that only very, very normal things can create when seen where the mind is unprepared for them and in an unfamiliar light. By his own personal time-scale, so far as he could estimate it, living as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns, it was eight years since he had left. But what time had passed here he could hardly guess. Indeed, what events had passed were beyond his exhausted comprehension, because this planet, his home, should not be here. Eight years ago, at lunch-time, this planet had been demolished, utterly destroyed, by the huge yellow Vogon ships which had hung in the lunch-time sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local regulation, and breaking it no more than a parking offence. "'Delusions,' said Russell. "'What?' said Arthur, startled out of his train of thought. "'She says she suffers from strange delusions that she's living in the real world. It's no good telling her she is living in the real world, because she just tells you that's why the delusions are so strange. Don't know about you, but I find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting. Give her the tablets and piss off for a beer, is my answer. I mean, you can only muck about so much, can't you?' Arthur frowned, not for the first time. "'Well, and all this dreams and nightmare stuff, and the doctor's going on about strange jumps and her brain-wave patterns.' "'Jumps?' "'This,' said Fenny." Arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open but utterly vacant eyes. Whatever she was looking at wasn't in the car. Her eyes fluttered, her head jerked once, and then she was sleeping peacefully. "'What did she say?' he asked anxiously. "'She said this.' "'This what?' "'This what? How the heck should I know? This hedgehog, that chimney-pot, the other pair of Don Alfonso's tweezers? She's barking mad. I thought I'd mentioned that.' "'You don't seem to care very much.' Arthur tried to say it as matter-of-factly as possible, but it didn't seem to work. "'Look, Buster. Okay, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean it to sound like that,' said Arthur. "'I know you care a lot, obviously,' he added, lying. "'I know that you have to deal with it somehow. You'll have to excuse me. I just hitched from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula.' He stared furiously out of the window. He was astonished that of all the sensationless fighting for room in his head on this night as he returned to the home that he thought had vanished into oblivion for ever, the one that was compelling him was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing other than that she had said this to him, and that he wouldn't wish her brother on a Vogon. "'So, uh, what were the jumps, these jumps you mentioned?' he went on to say as quickly as he could. "'Look, this is my sister. I don't even know why I'm talking to you about—' "'Okay, I'm sorry. Perhaps you'd better let me out. This is—' At the moment he said it, it became impossible, because the storm which had passed them by suddenly erupted again. Lightning belted through the sky, and someone seemed to have been pouring something which closely resembled the Atlantic Ocean over them through a sieve. Russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky blattered at them. He worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to pass a lorry marked McKenna's All-Weather Haulage. The tension eased as the rain subsided. "'It started with all that business of the CIA agent they found in the reservoir, when everybody had the hallucinations and everything, you remember?' Arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had just hitchhiked back from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula, and was for this and various other related and astounding reasons a little out of touch with recent events, but he decided it would only confuse matters further. "'No,' he said. "'That was the moment she cracked up. She was in a café somewhere, Rickmansworth. Don't know what she was doing there, but that was where she cracked up. Apparently she stood up, calmly announced she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or something, wobbled a bit, looked confused, and finally collapsed screaming into an egg sandwich.' Arthur winced. "'I'm very sorry to hear that,' he said a little stiffly. Russell made a sort of grumping noise. "'So what?' said Arthur, in an attempt to piece things together. "'What was the CIA agent doing in the reservoir?' "'Well, bobbing up and down, of course. He was dead.' "'But what—' "'Oh, come on, you remember all that stuff, the hallucinations. Everyone said it was a cock-up, the CIA trying experiments into drug warfare or something, some crackpot theory that instead of invading a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make everyone think they had been invaded.' "'What hallucinations were those exactly?' said Arthur in a rather quiet voice. "'What do you mean, what hallucinations? I'm talking about all that stuff with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and saying we're going to die, and then pop! They vanished as the effect wore off. The CIA denied it, which meant it must be true.' Arthur's head went a little swimmy. His hand grabbed at something to steady himself and gripped it tightly. His mouth made little opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say something, but nothing emerged. "'Anyway,' continued Russell, "'whatever drug it was, didn't seem to wear off so fast with Fenny. I was all for suing the CIA, but a lawyer friend of mine said it'd be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum with a banana, so—' He shrugged. "'The Vogon?' squeaked Arthur. "'The Vogon? The yellow ships vanished?' "'Well, of course they did. They were hallucinations,' said Russell, and he looked at Arthur oddly. "'You're trying to say you don't remember any of this? Where have you been, for heaven's sake?' This was, to Arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he half leapt out of his seat with shock. "'Christ!' yelled Russell, fighting to control the car, which was suddenly trying to skid. He pulled it out of the path of an oncoming lorry and swerved up onto a grass bank. As the car lurched to a halt, the girl in the back was thrown against Russell's seat and collapsed awkwardly. Arthur twisted round in horror. "'Is she all right?' he blurted out. Russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow-dried hair. He tugged at his blonde moustache. He turned to Arthur. "'Would you please,' he said, let go of the handbrake.
 New Millennium Audio presents So Long and Thanks for All the Fish by Douglas Adams read by the author
 XXI. Down on the dry red world of Kakrafoun, in the middle of the vast rudlet desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system. That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the technicians. They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's giant control ship, which hung in orbit some four hundred miles above the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldn't have survived the tuning-up. If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos, then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the silos, the neutron-phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky, obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seismic amps behind them. Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the massive photon adjuitar, the base detonator, and the megabang drum complex. It was going to be a noisy show. Aboard the giant control ship all was activity and bustle. Hot Black Desiato's limo-ship, a mere tadpole beside it, had arrived and docked, and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high-vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses onto the adjuitar keyboard. A doctor, a logician, and a marine biologist had also arrived, flown in at phenomenal expense from Maxi Megalon to try to reason with the lead singer, who had locked himself in the bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The bass player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom, and the drummer was nowhere on board. Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light-years away, where, he claimed, he had been happy for over half an hour now, and had found a small stone that would be his friend. The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot, and that therefore the timing of the symbolistics would be right. The sabitha was buzzing with the communications of the stage technicians testing the speaker channels, and this it was that was being relayed to the interior of the black ship. Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin and listened to the voices on the monitor speakers. OK, channel nine on power, said a voice. Testing channel fifteen. Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship. Channel fifteen A-OK, said another voice. A third voice cut in. The black stunt ship is now in position, it said. It's looking good, gonna be a great sun dive. Stage computer online? A computer voice answered. Online, it said. Take control of the black ship. Black ship locked into trajectory program on standby. Testing channel twenty. Saiford leapt across the cabin and switched frequencies on the sabitha receiver before the next mind-pulverising noise hit them. He stood there quivering. What, said Trillian in a small, quiet voice, does sun dive mean? It means, said Marvin, that the ship is going to dive into the sun. Sun. Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you expect if you see a hot black Desiato's stunt ship? How do you know, said Saiford in a voice that would make a vagin' snow lizard feel chilly, that this is hot black Desiato's stunt ship? Simple, said Marvin. I parked it for him. Then why didn't you tell us? You said you wanted excitement and adventure and we'd see wild things. This is awful, said Arthur, unnecessarily in the pause which followed. That's what I said, confirmed Marvin. On a different frequency the sabitha receiver had picked up a public broadcast which now echoed around the cabin. Fine weather for the concert here this afternoon. I'm standing here in the front of the stage – the reporter lied – in the middle of the ruddlit desert, and with the aid of hyper-panoptic glasses I can just about make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker stacks rise like a sheer cliff face, and high above me the sun is shining away and doesn't know what's going to hit it. The environmentalist lobby do know what's going to hit it, and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the usual things that environmentalists usually go on about. But I've just had a report that a representative of Disaster Area met with the environmentalists at lunchtime and had them all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of... Ford switched it off. He turned to Ford. "'You know what I'm thinking,' he said. "'I think so,' said Ford. "'Tell me what you think I'm thinking.' "'I think you're thinking it's time we got off this ship.' "'I think you're right,' said Zayford. "'I think you're right,' said Ford. "'How?' said Arthur. "'Quiet,' said Ford and Zayford. "'We're thinking.' "'So this is it,' said Arthur. "'We're going to die.' "'We should stop saying that,' said Ford. It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had come up with on his first encounter with human beings to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very, very obvious, as in, "'It's a nice day,' or, "'You're very tall,' or, "'So this is it, we're going to die.'" His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising their lips, their mouths probably seized up. After a few months of observation, he'd come up with a second theory, which was this. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, their brains start working. In fact, the second theory is more literally true of the Belcerabon people of Cacrophun. The Belcerabon people used to cause great resentment and insecurity amongst neighboring races by being one of the most enlightened, accomplished, and above all, quiet civilizations in the galaxy. As a punishment for this behavior, which was held to be offensively self-righteous and provocative, a galactic tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases—telepathy. Consequently, in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought that crosses their mind to anyone within a five-mile radius, they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon, and what a noisy place Cacrophun has suddenly become. Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play host to a disaster area concert. The timing of the concert was critical. The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to hit the sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of the solar flares had time to travel out to Cacrophun. The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time that Ford Prefect had completed his search of the other compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin. The sun of Cacrophun loomed terrifyingly large on the vision-screen, its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control-panel. Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare them out. Zaphod spun round, wild-eyed. "'Ford,' he said, "'how many escape-capsules are there?' "'None,' said Ford. Zaphod gibbered. "'Did you count them?' he yelled. "'Twice,' said Ford. "'Did you manage to raise the stage-crew on the radio?' "'Yeah,' said Zaphod bitterly. "'I said there are a whole bunch of people on board, and they said to say hi to everybody.' Ford goggled. "'Didn't you tell them who you were?' "'Oh, yeah. They said it was a great honour. That and something about a restaurant bill and my executors.' Ford pushed Arthur aside, roughly, and leaned forward over the control-console. "'Does none of this function?' he said savagely. "'All overridden. Smash the autopilot. Find it first. Nothing connects.' There was a moment's cold silence. Arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin. He stopped suddenly. "'Incidentally,' he said, "'what does teleport mean?' Another moment passed. Slowly the others turned to face him. "'Probably the wrong question to ask,' said Arthur. "'It's just I remember hearing you use the word a short while ago, and I only bring it up because—' "'Where,' said Ford quietly, "'does it say teleport?' "'Well, just over here, in fact,' said Arthur, pointing at a dark control-box in the rear of the cabin. "'Just under the word emergency, above the word system, and beside the sign saying out of order.' In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to follow was that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the single small black button set into it. The six-foot square panel slid open beside it, revealing a compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new function in life as an electrician's junk store. Half-finished wiring hung from the ceiling, a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on the floor, and the programming panel lolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have been secured. A junior disaster area accountant visiting the shipyard where the ship was being constructed had demanded to know of the work's form and why the hell they were fitting an extremely expensive teleport into a ship that only had one important journey to make, and that unmanned. The foreman had explained that the teleport was available at a 10% discount, and the accountant had explained that this was immaterial. The foreman had explained that it was the finest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could buy, and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to buy it. The foreman had explained that the people would still need to enter and leave the ship, and the accountant had explained that the ship sported a perfectly serviceable door. The foreman had explained that the accountant could go and boil his head, and the accountant had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly from his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had been concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport, which subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as Sund Expluns, at five times the price. "'Hell's donkeys,' muttered Zephod as he and Ford attempted to sort through the tangle of wiring. After a moment or so Ford told him to stand back. He tossed a coin into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel. With a crackle and a spit of light the coin vanished. "'That much of it works,' said Ford. "'However, there's no guidance system. A mere matter transference teleport with no guidance programming could put you, well, anywhere.' The son of Kakrafoun loomed huge on the screen. "'Who cares?' said Zephod. "'We go where we go.' "'And,' said Ford, "'there's no auto-system. We couldn't all go. Someone would have to stay here and operate it.' A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger. "'Hey, Marvin, kid,' said Zephod brightly. "'How are you doing?' "'Very badly, I suspect,' muttered Marvin. A shortish while later the concert on Kakrafoun reached an unexpected climax. The black ship, with its single morose occupant, had plunged on schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, and in some cases spilling the dozen or so flare-riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment. Moments before the flare-light reached Kakrafoun, the pounding desert cracked along a deep fault line, a huge and hitherto undetected underground river, lying far beneath the sand, gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air, instantaneously vaporising the river, both above and below the surface, in an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again. Those very few who witnessed the event and survived swear that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself over and fell back down again. At that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporised water and struck the ground. A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick with flowers. The structure of the atmosphere around the planet was subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the desert world of Kakrafoun became a paradise. Even the telepathic power with which the people of Kakrafoun had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion. A spokesman for Disaster Area, the one who had had all the environmentalists shot, was later quoted as saying that it had been a good gig. Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few sceptical scientists examined the records of the events even more closely and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast, artificially-induced improbability field drifting in from a nearby region of space.

 Chapter 37 For a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in stunned amazement straddling the remains of Knightsbridge, swaying slightly, and trying to work out a number of things. Government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the truckload each asked each other questions on the air about what they thought of it, flights of fighter-bombers tried pathetically to attack it, but no lizards appeared. It scanned the horizon slowly. At night it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did nothing. It thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion. It would have to send out its service robots. It should have thought of that before, but it was having a number of problems. The tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal. They roamed the surrounding terrain, frantically attacking some things and defending others. One of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little in the area survived. A turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers discovered the zoo in Regent's Park and most particularly the reptile house. Learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the pet shop, the flying drills and fret-saws brought some of the larger and fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot, who tried to conduct high-level talks with them. Eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full, frank, and wide-ranging exchange of views the high-level talks had broken down, the lizards had been retired, and that it, the robot, would take a short holiday somewhere and for some reason selected Bournemouth. Ward Prefect, watching it on TV, nodded, laughed, and had another beer. Great preparations were made for its departure. The flying tool-kit screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things with light throughout that day and all through the night-time, and in the morning, stunningly, a giant mobile gantry started to roll westwards on several roads simultaneously, with the robot standing on it, supported within the gantry. Westward it crawled like a strange carnival buzzed around by its servants and helicopters and news-coaches scything through the land, until at last it came to Bournemouth, where the robot slowly freed itself of its transport-systems and braces, and went and lay for ten days on the beach. It was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever happened to Bournemouth. Crowds gathered daily along the perimeter, which was staked out and guarded as the robot's recreation area, and tried to see what it was doing. It was doing nothing. It was lying on the beach. It was lying a little awkwardly on its face. It was a journalist from a local paper who, late one night, managed to do what no one else in the world had so far managed, which was to strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service-robots guarding the perimeter. It was an extraordinary breakthrough. —I think there's a story in it, confided the journalist over a cigarette shared through the steel-link fence, but it needs a good local angle. I've got a little list of questions in my pocket. —He went on, rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket. Perhaps you could get him—it, whatever you call him—to run through them quickly. The little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it could do, and screeched off. A reply was never forthcoming. Curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or less exactly matched the questions that were going through the massive battle-scarred industrial-quality circuits of the robot's head. They were these. How do you feel about being a robot? How does it feel to be from outer space? And how do you like Bournemouth? Early the following day things started to be packed up, and within a few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave for good. —The point is, said Fenchurch to Ford, can you get us on board? —Frenchman Ford looked wildly at his watch. —I have some serious unfinished business to attend to! he exclaimed.
 XIII. Zephod Biblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel like the hell of a guy he was. He was very confused, but continued crawling doggedly anyway, because he was that brave. He was confused by something he had just seen, but not half as confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear, so it would be best at this point to explain exactly where he was. He was in the Robot War Zones, many miles above the surface of the planet Cricket. The atmosphere was thin here, and relatively unprotected from any rays or anything that space might care to hurl in this direction. He had parked the starship Heart of Gold among the huge jostling dim hulks that crowded the sky here above Cricket, and had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky buildings, armed with nothing but a zap-gun and something for his headaches. He had found himself in a long, wide, and badly lit corridor, in which he was able to hide until he worked out what he was going to do next. He hid, because every now and then one of the Cricket robots would walk along it, and although he had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands, it had nevertheless been an extremely painful one, and he had no desire to stretch what he was only half inclined to call his good fortune. He had ducked at one point into a room leading off the corridor, and had discovered it to be a huge and again dimly lit chamber. In fact it was a museum with just one exhibit—the wreckage of a spacecraft. It was terribly burnt and mangled, and now that he had caught up with some of the galactic history he had missed through his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the cyber-cubicle next to him at school, he was able to put in an intelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship that had drifted through the dust-cloud all those billions of years ago, and started this whole business off. But—and this is where he had become confused—there was something not at all right about it. It was genuinely wrecked, it was genuinely burnt, but a fairly brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a genuine spacecraft. It was as if it were a full-scale model of one—a solid blueprint. In other words, it was a very useful thing to have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself, and didn't know how to do it. It was not, however, anything that would ever fly anywhere itself. He was still puzzling over this—in fact he had only just started to puzzle over it—when he became aware that a door had slid open in another part of the chamber, and another couple of cricket-robots had entered, looking a little glum. Zaford did not want to tangle with them, and deciding that just as discretion was the better part of valour, so was cowardice the better part of discretion, he valiantly hid himself in a cupboard. The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of a shaft that led down through an inspection hatch into a wide ventilation tunnel. He let himself down into it, and started to crawl along it. He didn't like it. It was cold, dark, and profoundly uncomfortable, and it frightened him. At the first opportunity, which was another shaft a hundred yards further along, he climbed back up out of it. This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to be a computer intelligence centre. He emerged in a dark, narrow space between a large computer-bank and the wall. He quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber, and started to leave again when he began to listen with interest to what the other occupants were saying. "'It's the robots, sir,' said one voice. "'There's something wrong with them.' "'What exactly?' These were the voices of two War Command cricketers. "'All the War Commanders lived up in the sky in the robot war zones, and were largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties that were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet. "'Well, sir, I think it's just as well that they are being phased out of the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the supernova bomb. In the very short time since we were released from the envelope—' "'Get to the point.' "'The robots aren't enjoying it, sir.' "'What?' "'The war, sir. It seems to be getting them down. There's a certain world-weariness about them, or perhaps I should say universe-weariness.' "'Well, that's all right. They're meant to be helping to destroy it.' "'Oh, yes, well, they're finding it difficult, sir. They are afflicted with a certain lassitude. They're just finding it hard to get behind the job. They lack oomph.' "'What are you trying to say?' "'Well, I think they're very depressed about something, sir.' "'What on cricket are you talking about?' "'Well, in the few skirmishes they've had recently, it seems that they go into battle, raise their weapons to fire, and suddenly think, why bother? What, cosmically speaking, is it all about? And they just seem to get a little tired and a little grim.' "'And then what do they do?' "'Quadratic equations, mostly, sir. Fiendishly difficult ones, by all accounts. And then they sulk.' "'Sulk?' "'Yes, sir.' "'Who ever heard of a robot sulking?' "'I don't know, sir.' "'What was that noise?' "'It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his heads spinning.'
 XX. The restaurant continued existing, but everything else had stopped. Temporal Relestatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing, there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist. The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, the party was over, the diners were leaving, Zarkwan had vanished along with the rest of the universe, the time-turbines were preparing to pull the restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for the lunch-sitting, and Max Quartlepleen was back in his small, curtained dressing-room, trying to raise his agent on the temperphone. In the car-park stood the Black Ship, closed and silent. Into the car-park came the late Mr Hot Black Desiato, propelled along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard. They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the limo-ship a hatchway swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the wheelchair, and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having seen his boss safely connected up to his death-support system, moved up to the small cockpit. Here he operated the remote-control system which activated the autopilot in the Black Ship lying next to the limo, thus causing great relief to Zephod Biblebrox, who had been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes. The Black Ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned, and moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch-chamber, and began the long journey back into the distant past. The Millieway's Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this, The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of survival, inquiry, and sophistication, otherwise known as the how, why, and where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question, How can we eat? The second by the question, Why do we eat? And the third by the question, Where shall we have lunch? The menu goes on to suggest that Millieway's, the restaurant at the end of the universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third question. What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually take a large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the how, why, and where phases, small social groupings under stressful conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity. How are we doing? said Arthur Dent. Badly, said Ford Prefect. Where are we going? said Trillian. I don't know, said Zaphod Beeblebrox. Why not? demanded Arthur Dent. Shut up! suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect. Basically what you are trying to say, said Arthur Dent, ignoring the suggestion, is that we are out of control. The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engines howled and whined like tired children in a supermarket. It's the wild colour screen that freaks me, said Zaphod, whose love affair with the ship had lasted almost three minutes into the flight. Every time you try to operate one of those weird black controls that are labelled in black on a black background, a little black light lights up black to let you know you've done it. I mean, what is this, some kind of galactic hyperhurse? The walls of the swaying cabin were also black. The ceiling was black. The seats, which were rudimentary since the only important trip the ship was designed for was supposed to be unmanned, were black. The control panel was black. The instruments were black. The little screws that held them in place were black. The thin tufted nylon floor covering was black. And when they lifted up a corner of it they discovered that the foam underlay was also black. Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wavelengths of a trillion. We didn't have much imagination, muttered Arthur. Yes, said Marvin. He was feeling very depressed. In fact, though they didn't know it, the decor had been chosen in honour of its owner's sad, lamented and tax-deductible condition. The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch. Take it easy, pleaded Arthur, or you're making me space-sick. Time-sick, said Ford. We're plummeting backward through time. Thank you, said Arthur. Now I think I really am going to be ill. Ah, go ahead, said Zaphod. We could do a little colour about the place. This is meant to be polite after-dinner conversation, is it? snapped Arthur. Zaphod left the controls to Ford to figure out, and lurched over to Arthur. Look, Earthman, he said angrily, you've got a job to do, right? The questions are the element answer, right? What, that thing? said Arthur. I thought we'd forgotten about that. Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of money in the right quarters, and it's all locked up in that head thing of yours. Yes, but... But nothing. You think about it. The meaning of life. We get our fingers on that, we can hold every shrink in the galaxy up to ransom, and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint. Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm. All right, he said, but where do we start? I mean, how shall I know? They say the ultimate answer or whatever is forty-two. How am I supposed to know what the question is? It could be anything. I mean, what's six times seven? Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with excitement. Forty-two! he cried. Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead. Yes, he said patiently, I know that. Zaphod's faces fell. I'm just saying the question could be anything at all, said Arthur, and I don't see how I'm meant to know. Because, said Zaphod, you were there when your planet did the big firework. We have a thing on earth, began Arthur. Had, corrected Zaphod. Called tact. Oh, never mind. Look, I just don't know. A low voice echoed dully round the cabin. I know, said Marvin. Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing battle with. Stay out of this, Marvin! He said this is organism talk. It's printed in the earthman's brainwave patterns, continued Marvin, but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing that. You mean, said Arthur, you mean you can see into my mind? Yes, said Marvin. Arthur stared in astonishment. And, he said, it amazes me how you manage to live in anything that small. Ah, said Arthur, abuse! Yes, confirmed Marvin. Ignore him, said Zaphod. He's only making it up. Making it up, said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of astonishment. Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad enough as it is, without wanting to invent any more of it. Marvin, said Trillian, in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature. If you knew all along, then why didn't you tell us? Marvin's head swivelled back to her. You didn't ask, he said simply. Well, we're asking you now, metal man, said Ford, turning round to look at him. At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying. The engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum. Hey, Ford, said Zaphod. That sounds good. Have you worked out the controls on this boat? No, said Ford. I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon we've just got to go wherever this ship is going and get off it fast. Yeah, right, said Zaphod. I could tell you weren't really interested, murmured Marvin to himself, and slumped into a corner and switched himself off. Trouble is, said Ford, that the one instrument in this whole ship that's giving any reading is worrying me. If it's what I think it is, and it's saying what I think it's saying, then we've already gone too far back into the past, maybe as much as two million years before our own time. Zaphod shrugged. Time is bunk, he said. I wonder who this ship belongs to, anyway, said Arthur. Me, said Zaphod. No, I mean who it really belongs to. No, really me, insisted Zaphod. Look, property is theft, right? Therefore theft is property, therefore this ship is mine, okay? Tell the ship that, said Arthur. Zaphod strode over to the console. Ship, he said, banging on the panels, this is your new owner speaking to... He got no further. Several things happened at once. The ship dropped out of time-travel mode and re-emerged into real space. All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the time-trip, now lit up. A large vision screen above the console winked into life, revealing a wide starscape and a single, very large sun dead ahead of them. None of these things, however, was responsible for the fact that Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin, as were all the others. They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thudded out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen.
 Ah!" said Trillian, taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping herself. A social climber!
 Chapter 40 There remains little still to tell. Beyond what used to be known as the limitless light-fields of Flannox, until the grey-binding fiefdoms of Saxoquin were discovered lying behind them, lie the grey-binding fiefdoms of Saxoquin. Within the grey-binding fiefdoms of Saxoquin lies the star named Zars, around which orbits the planet Priliumtan, in which is the land of Seville-Biupstre, and it was to the land of Seville-Biupstre that Arthur and Fenchurch came at last, a little tired by the journey. And in the land of Seville-Biupstre they came to the great red plain of Raaz, which was bounded on the south side by the quaintly Quasgar mountains, on the further side of which, according to the dying words of Prack, they would find in thirty-foot-high letters of fire God's final message to His creation. According to Prack, if Arthur's memory served him right, the place was guarded by the logistic vantreshell of Lobb, and so, after a manner, it proved to be. He was a little man in a strange hat, and he sold them a ticket. "'Cape to the left, please,' he said. "'Cape to the left,' and hurried on past them on a little scooter. They realised they were not the first to pass that way, for the path that led around the left of the great plain was well worn and dotted with booths. At one they bought a box of fudge, which had been baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain, which was heated by the fire of the letters that formed God's final message to His creation. At another they bought some postcards. The letters had been blurred with an airbrush. "'So as not to spoil the big surprise,' it said on the reverse. "'Do you know what the message is?' they asked the wizened little lady in the booth. "'Oh, yes!' she piped cheerily. "'Oh, yes!' she waved them on. Every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers and sanitary facilities, but the going was tough, and the high sun baked down on the great red plain, and the great red plain rippled in the heat. "'Is it possible,' asked Arthur at one of the larger booths, "'to rent one of these little scooters, like the one Logistic Venture Wotsit had?' "'The scooters,' said the little lady, who was serving at the ice-cream bar, "'are not for the devout.' "'Oh, well, that's easy, then,' said Fenchurch. "'We're not particularly devout. We're just interested.' "'Then you must turn back now,' said the little lady severely, and when they demurred sold them a couple of final-message sun-hats and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each other on the great red plain of Raz. They drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth, and then trudged out into the sun again. "'We're running out of barrier-cream,' said Fenchurch, after a few more miles. "'We can go on to the next booth, or we can return to the previous one, which is nearer, but it means we have to retrace our steps again.' They stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat-haze. They looked behind themselves. They elected to go on. They then discovered that they were not only not the first to make this journey, but they were not the only ones making it now. Some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself wretchedly along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half limping, half crawling. It was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the creature up, and could see that it was made of worn, scarred, and twisted metal. It groaned at them as they approached it, collapsing in the hot, dry dust. "'So much time,' it groaned. "'Oh, so much time! And pain as well. So much of that, and so much time to suffer it in too. One or the other on its own I could probably manage. It's the two together that really get me down. Oh, hello, you again!' "'Marvin!' said Arthur, sharply, crouching down beside it. "'Is that you?' "'You were always one,' groaned the aged husk of the robot. "'For the super-intelligent question, weren't you?' "'What is it?' whispered Fenchurch in alarm, crouching down behind Arthur and grasping on to his arm. "'He's a sort of an old friend,' said Arthur. "'I—friend!' croaked the robot pathetically. The word died away any kind of crackle and flicks of rust fell out of his mouth. You'll have to excuse me while I try and remember what the word means. My memory-banks are not what they were, you know, and any word which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down into auxiliary memory-backup. Ah, here it comes!' The robot's battered head snapped up a bit, as if in thought. "'H'm,' he said. "'What a curious concept!' He thought a little longer. "'No,' he said at last. "'Don't think I ever came across one of those. Sorry, can't help you there.' He scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, and then tried to twist himself up on to his misshapen elbows. "'Is there any last service you would like me to perform for you, perhaps?' he asked in a kind of hollow rattle. "'A piece of paper that perhaps you would like me to pick up for you. Or maybe you would like me,' he continued, "'to open a door.' His head scratched around in its rusty neck-bearings, and seemed to scan the distant horizon. "'Don't seem to be any doors around at present,' he said. "'But I'm sure that if we waited long enough someone would build one. And then,' he said, slowly twisting his head around to see Arthur again, "'I could open it for you. I'm quite used to waiting, you know.' "'Arthur!' hissed Fenchurch in his ear sharply. "'You never told me of this. What have you done to this poor creature?' "'Nothing,' insisted Arthur sadly. "'He's always like this.' "'Ah!' snapped Marvin. "'Ah!' he repeated. "'What do you know of always? You say always to me, who because of the silly little errands your organic life-forms keep on sending me through time on, am now thirty-seven times older than the universe itself. Pick your words with a little more care,' he coughed, and tacked. He rasped his way through a coughing-fit, and resumed. "'Leave me,' he said. "'Go on ahead. Leave me to struggle painfully on my way. My time at last is nearly come. My race is nearly run. I fully expect,' he said, feebly waving the wand with a broken finger, "'to come in last. It would be fitting. Here I am, brain the size.' Between them they picked him up, despite his feeble protests and insults. The metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers, but he weighed surprisingly little, and hung limply between their arms. They carried him with them along the path that ran along the left of the great red plain of Raz, towards the encircling mountains of Quentilus Quasgar. Arthur attempted to explain to Fenchurch, but was too often interrupted by Marvin's dolerous cybernetic ravings. They tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of the booths, and some soothing oil, but Marvin would have none of it. "'I am all spare parts,' he droned. "'Let me be,' he groaned. "'Every part of me,' he moaned, "'has been replaced at least fifty times. Except—' He seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a moment. His head bobbed between them, with the effort of memory. "'Do you remember the first time you ever met me?' he said at last to Arthur. "'I had been given the intellect-stretching task of taking you up to the bridge. I mentioned to you that I had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side, that I had asked for them to be replaced, but they never were.' He left a longish pause before he continued. They carried him on between them, under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to move, let alone set. "'See if you can guess,' said Marvin, when he judged that the pause had become embarrassing enough, "'which parts of me were never replaced. Go on, see if you can guess.' "'Ouch!' he added. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!' At last they reached the last of the little booths, sat Marvin down between them, and rested in the shade. Fenchurch bought some cufflinks for Russell—cufflinks that had set in them little polished pebbles which had been picked up from the Quentillers' Quasgar Mountains, directly underneath the Letters of Fire, in which was written God's final message to His creation. Arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the counter, little meditations on the meaning of the message. "'Ready?' he said to Fenchurch, who nodded. They heaved up Marvin between them. They rounded the foot of the Quentillers' Quasgar Mountains, and there was the message, written in blazing letters along the crest of the mountain. There was a little observation vantage-point, with a rail built along the top of a large rock facing it, from which you could get a good view. It had a little pay-telescope for looking at the letters in detail, but no one would ever use it, because the letters, burnt with the divine brilliance of the heavens, and would, if seen through a telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve. They gazed at God's final message in wonderment, and were slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace and a final and complete understanding. Then Church sighed. "'Yes,' she said. "'That was it.' They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes, before they became aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in difficulties. The robot could no longer lift his head, had not read the message. They lifted his head, but he complained that his vision-circuits had almost gone. They found a coin and helped him to the telescope. He complained and insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter in turn. The first letter was a W, the second an E, then there was a gap, an A followed, then a P, an O, and an L. Marvin paused for a rest. After a few moments they resumed and let him see the O, the G, the I, the S, and the E. The next two words were FOR and THE. The last one was a long one, and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it. It started with I, then N, then a C, next came an O and an N, followed by a V, an E, another N, and an I. After a final pause Marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch. He read the E, the N, the C, and at last the final E, and staggered back into their arms. I think, he murmured at last from deep within his corroding, rattling thorax, I feel good about it. The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever. Luckily there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from guys with green wings.
 Chapter 15 The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It has been built on the fragmented remains of—it will be built on the fragmented—that is to say, it will have been built by this time, and indeed has been. One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broad-minded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is also no problem about changing the course of history. The course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change, and it all sorts itself out in the end. The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you, for instance, how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be described differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past, and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own mother or father. Most readers get as far as the future, semi-conditionally modified, sub-inverted, plagal, past subjunctive, intentional before giving up. And in fact, in later editions of the book, all pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term future perfect has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. To resume, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined planet which is, or we all haven't be, enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected forward in time for the precise moment of the end of the universe. This is, many would say, impossible. In it guests take, will and on take, their places at table, and eat, will and on eat, sumptuous meals whilst watching, will and watch, and the whole of creation explode around them. This, many would say, is equally impossible. You can arrive, may and arrive and on when, for any sitting you like, without prior, late for when, reservation, because you can book retrospectively, as it were, when you return to your own time. You can have on book have enter for when presooning returning when to a retro home. This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible. At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with, may and meet and con with, dine and on when, a fascinating cross-section of the entire population of space and time. This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible. You can visit it as many times as you like, may and on visit, re-on visiting, and so on. For further tense correction consult Dr. Street-Menschener's book. And be sure of never meeting yourself because of the embarrassment this usually causes. This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently impossible, say the doubters. All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the end of time, the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for. This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane, which is why the advertising executives of the star system of Battelblanc came up with this slogan. If you've done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Millie Way's, the restaurant at the end of the universe.
 XXVII. I trust you had a pleasant meal, said Zarny-Whoop to Zaphod and Trillian as they rematerialised on the bridge of the Starship Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor. Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him. "'You!' he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find a chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it. "'I have programmed the computer with the improbability coordinates pertinent to our journey,' said Zarny-Whoop. "'We will arrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why don't you relax and prepare yourself for the meeting?' Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a small cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Jank's spirit. He took a long pull at it. "'And when this is all done,' said Zaphod savagely, ''it's done, all right. I'm free to go and do what the hell I like and lie on beaches and stuff.' "'It depends what transpires from the meeting,' said Zarny-Whoop. "'Zaphod, who is this man?' said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her feet. "'What's he doing here? Why is he on our ship?' "'He's a very stupid man,' said Zaphod, 'who wants to meet the man who rules the universe.'

 Chapter 24 It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes. For instance, there was once an insanely aggressive race of people called the Silastic Armor Fiends of Strytorax. That was just the name of their race. The name of their army was something quite horrific. Luckily, they lived even farther back in galactic history than anything we have so far encountered, twenty billion years ago when the galaxy was young and fresh and every idea worth fighting for was a new one. And fighting was what the Silastic Armor Fiends of Strytorax were good at, and being good at it, they did it a lot. They fought their enemies, i.e. everybody else, they fought each other. Their planet was a complete wreck. The surface was littered with abandoned cities that were surrounded by abandoned war machines, which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the Silastic Armor Fiends lived and squabbled with each other. The best way to pick a fight with the Silastic Armor Fiend of Strytorax was just to be born. They didn't like it, they got resentful. And when an Armor Fiend got resentful, someone got hurt. An exhausting way of life, one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of energy. The best way of dealing with the Silastic Armor Fiend was to put him in a room on his own because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up. Eventually, they realized that this is something they were going to have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who had to carry a weapon as part of his normal Silastic work – policemen, security guards, primary school teachers, etc. – had to spend at least 45 minutes every day punching a sack of potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggression. For a while this worked well, until someone thought it would be much more efficient and less time-consuming if they simply shot the potatoes instead. This led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things, and they all got very excited at the prospect of their first major war for weeks. Another achievement of the Silastic Armor Fiends of Striderax is that they were the first race who ever managed to shock a computer. It was a gigantic space-borne computer called Haktar, which to this day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built. It was the first to be built like a natural brain, in that every cellular particle of it carried the pattern of the whole within it, which enabled it to think more flexibly and imaginatively, and also, it seemed, to be shocked. The Silastic Armor Fiends of Striderax were engaged in one of their regular wars with the strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and were not enjoying it as much as usual, because it involved an awful lot of trekking through the radiation swamps of Kualzenda and across the fire-mountains of Fraz-Fraga, neither of which terrains they felt at home in. So when the strangler Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined in the fray and forced them to fight another front in the gamma caves of Karfrax and the ice-storms of Valanguten, they decided that enough was enough, and they ordered Haktar to design for them an ultimate weapon. "'What do you mean?' asked Haktar, by ultimate, to which the Silastic Armor Fiends of Striderax said, read a bloody dictionary, and plunged back into the fray. So Haktar designed an ultimate weapon. It was a very, very small bomb, that was simply a junction-box in hyperspace which would, when activated, connect the heart of every major sun with the heart of every other major sun simultaneously, and thus turn the entire universe into one gigantic hyperspatial supernova. When the Silastic Armor Fiends tried to use it to blow up a strangler Stilettan munitions dump in one of the gamma caves, they were extremely irritated that it didn't work, and said so. Haktar had been shocked by the whole idea. He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this ultimate weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the known consequence of setting it off, and he had therefore taken the liberty of introducing a small flaw into the design of the bomb, and he hoped that everyone involved would on sober reflection feel that the Silastic Armor Fiends disagreed and pulverized the computer. Later they thought better of it and destroyed the faulty bomb as well. Then, pausing only to smash the hell out of the strenuous Garfighters of Stug and the strangler Stilettans of Jajazikstak, they then went on to find an entirely new way of blowing themselves up, which was a profound relief to everyone else in the galaxy, particularly the Garfighters, the Stilettans, and the Potatoes. Trillian had watched all this as well as the story of Cricket. She emerged from the room of informational illusions thoughtfully, just in time to discover that they had arrived too late.
 Chapter XXXIII. The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc. Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the theft of the ashes by the cricket robots. Through the smoke people were running, panic-stricken, colliding with each other, tripping over stretchers, being arrested. One policeman was attempting to arrest Wildbagger the Infinitely Prolonged for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall grey-green alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away, thus causing even more panic and pandemonium. In the middle of this suddenly materialised for the second time that afternoon the figures of Arthur Denton IV Prefect, who had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold, which was now in parking orbit around the planet. "'I can explain!' shouted Arthur. "'I have the ashes. They're in this bag!' "'I don't think you have their attention,' said Ford. "'I have also helped save the universe!' called Arthur to anyone who was prepared to listen, in other words, no one. "'That should have been a crowd-stopper,' said Arthur to Ford. "'It wasn't,' said Ford. Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past. "'Excuse me,' he said, "'the ashes. I've got them. They were stolen by those white robots a moment ago. I've got them in this bag. They were part of the key to slow time envelope, you see. And well, anyway, you can guess the rest. The point is, I've got them and what shall I do with them?' The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume he was speaking metaphorically. He wandered about disconsolately. "'There's no one interested!' he shouted. A man rushed past him and jogged his elbow. He dropped the paper bag, and it spilt its contents all over the ground. Arthur stared down at it with a tight-set mouth. Ford looked at him. "'Want to go now?' he said. Arthur heaved a heavy sigh. He looked round at the planet Earth for what he was now certain would be the last time. "'Okay,' he said. At that moment he caught sight through the clearing smoke of one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything. "'Hold on a moment,' he said to Ford. "'When I was a boy—' "'Can you tell me later?' said Ford. "'I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn't very good at it—or not at all, if you prefer. And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl at Lords.' He looked round him at the panic-stricken throng. No one was going to mind very much. "'Okay,' said Ford, wearily. "'Get it over with. I shall be over there,' he added, being bored. He went and sat down on a patch of smoking grass. Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon the cricket-ball had actually landed in his bag, and he looked through the bag. He had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it wasn't the same bag he had had at the time. Still there it was among the souvenirs of Greece. He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat on it and polished it again. He put the bag down. He was going to do this properly. He tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling its weight. With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern he trotted off away from the wicket. A medium fast pace, he decided, measured a good long run-up. He looked up into the sky. The birds were wheeling about, a few white clouds scuttered across it. The air was disturbed at the sound of police and ambulance sirens and people screaming and yelling, but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all. He was going to bowl a ball at Lords.' He turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his bedroom slippers. He squared his shoulders, tossed the ball in the air, and caught it again. He started to run. As he ran he suddenly saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman. Oh, good, he thought, that should add a little. Then as his running feet took him nearer he saw more clearly. The batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the England cricket team. He was not one of the Australian cricket team. He was one of the robot cricket team. It was a cold, hard, lethal, white killer robot that presumably had not returned to its ship with the others. Quite a few thoughts collided in Arthur Dent's mind at this moment, but he didn't seem to be able to stop running. Time suddenly seemed to be going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn't seem to be able to stop running. Moving as though through syrup, he slowly turned his troubled head and looked at his own hand, the hand that was holding the small, hard, red ball. His feet were pounding slowly onward, unstoppably, as he stared at the ball gripped in his helpless hand. It was emitting a deep red glow and flashing intermittently, and still his feet were pounding inexorably forward. He looked at the cricket robot again, standing implacably still and purposeful in front of him, battle-club raised in readiness. Its eyes were burning with a deep, cold, fascinating light, and Arthur could not move his own eyes from them. He seemed to be looking down a tunnel at them. Nothing on either side seemed to exist. Some of the thoughts that were colliding in his mind at this time were these. He felt a hell of a fool. He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a number of things he had heard said, phrases that now pounded round his mind as his feet pounded onward to the point where he would inevitably release the ball to the cricket robot, who would inevitably strike it. He remembered Haktar saying, Have I failed? Failure doesn't bother me. He remembered the account of Haktar's dying words, What's done is done. I have fulfilled my function. He remembered Haktar saying that he had managed to make a few things. He remembered the sudden movement in his holdall that had made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the dust-cloud. He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days to come to Lourdes again. He also remembered that he wasn't a very good bowler. He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball that he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb, which Haktar had built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would cause the universe to come to an abrupt and premature end. He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realised there was a contradiction involved here and he merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife. He would feel very, very embarrassed meeting everybody. He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this moment and universal oblivion. He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he felt his feet connecting with the holdall he'd stupidly left lying on the ground in front of him, he felt himself falling heavily forward, but having his mind so terribly full of other things at this point, he completely forgot about hitting the ground and didn't. Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand, he soared up into the air, whimpering with surprise. He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control. He twisted down toward the ground, flinging himself hectically through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into the distance. He hurtled toward the astounded robot from behind. It still had its multifunctional battle club raised, but had suddenly been deprived of anything to hit. With a sudden mad outburst of strength, he wrested the battle club from the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn in the air, hurtled back down in a furious power dive, and with one crazy swing, knocked the robot's head from the robot's shoulders. Are you coming now? said Ford.
 Chapter 2 Rob McKenna was a miserable bastard, and he knew it, because he had had a lot of people pointed out to him over the years, and he saw no reason to disagree with him, except the obvious one, which was that he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, which included, at the last count, everybody. He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear. The hill was beginning to steepen, and his lorry was heavy with Danish thermostatic radiator controls. It wasn't that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly. At least he hoped not. It was just the rain which got him down, always the rain. It was raining now, just for a change. It was a particular type of rain that he particularly disliked, particularly when he was driving. He had a number for it. It was rain type seventeen. He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbour's boots, all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you're going out fishing, and snow that, despite all your efforts to train them, the Huskies have pissed on. Rob McKenna had two hundred and thirty-one different types of rain entered into his little book, and he didn't like any of them. He shifted down another gear, and the lorry heaved its revs up. It grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish thermostatic radiating controls it was carrying. Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon he had been through types thirty-three—light, pricking drizzle, which made the roads slippery—thirty-nine—heavy, spotting—forty-seven to fifty-one—vertical light drizzle, through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle, freshening—eighty-seven and eighty-eight, two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour—one hundred—post-downpour squalling, cold—all the sea-storm types between one hundred and ninety-two and two hundred and thirteen at once—one hundred and twenty-three, one hundred and twenty-four, one hundred and twenty-six, one hundred and twenty-seven, mild and intermediate cold gusting regular and syncopated cab drumming, eleven breezy droplets, and now his least favourite of all—seventeen. Rain type seventeen was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that it didn't make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off. He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse. It just failed to get better again when he turned them back on. In fact, one of the wiper-blades began to flap off. Swish, swish, swish, flop, swish, swish, flop, swish, swish, flop, swish, flop, swish, flop, flop, flop, scrape. He pounded his steering-wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his cassette-player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore. It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking, that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the blatter, a figure by the roadside. A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in a washing-machine, and hitching. Poor miserable sod, thought Rob McKenna to himself, realising that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself. Must be chill to the bone. Stupid you'd be out hitching on a filthy night like this. All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving through puddles at you. He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a turn, and hit a large sheet of water square on. See what I mean? he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it. He had some right bastards on the road. Splattered in his rear-mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitch-hiker, drenched by the roadside. For a moment he felt good about this. A moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it. Then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it, and, satisfied, drove on into the night. At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles. And as he drove on the rain-clouds dragged down the sky after him, for though he did not know it, Rob McKenna was a rain-god. All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him and to water him.
 Chapter 11 The total perspective vortex derives its picture of the whole universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses. To explain, since every single piece of matter in the universe is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the universe, it is, in theory, possible to extrapolate the whole of creation—every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition, their economic and social history—from, say, one small piece of fairy cake. The man who invented the total perspective vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife. Trintagula—for that was his name—was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher, or, as his wife would have it, an idiot. And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake. Have some sense of proportion, she would say, sometimes as often as thirty-eight times in a single day. And so he built the total perspective vortex just to show her. And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife, so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it. To Trintagula's horror the shock completely annihilated her brain, but to his satisfaction he realised that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion. The door of the vortex swung open. From his disembodied mind Gargavar watched dejectedly. He had rather liked Zephod Beevilbrox in a strange sort of way. He was clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad ones. He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all did. Instead he stepped out. Hi, he said. Beevilbrox gasped Gargavar's mind in amazement. Could I have a drink, please? said Zephod. You have been in the vortex? stammered Gargavar. Ah, yeah, you saw me, kid. And it was working? Sure was. And you saw the whole infinity of creation? Oh, sure. A really neat place, you know that? Gargavar's mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body been with him, it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging open. And you saw yourself? said Gargavar. In relation to it all? Oh, yeah, yeah. But what did you experience? Zephod shrugged smugly. Ah, just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific great guy. Hey, didn't I tell you, baby? I'm Zephod Beevilbrox! His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and suddenly stopped, startled. He breathed heavily. Hey, he said, is that really a piece of fairy cake? He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with which it was surrounded. If I told you how much I needed this, he said ravenously, I wouldn't have time to eat it. He ate it.
 Chapter XXXIV The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A bird sang. A warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods. An insect drone passed on its way to whatever it is that insects do in the late afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the trees, followed a moment later by two girls, who stopped in surprise at the sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, apparently lying on the ground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter. No, no, no, don't go, called Ford Prefect between gasps. We'll be with you in just a moment. What's the matter? asked one of the girls. She was the taller and slimmer of the two. On Golgar Frinsham she had been a junior personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much. Ford pulled himself together. Excuse me, he said. Hello. My friend and I were just contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise. Oh, it's you, said the girl. You made a bit of a spectacle of yourself this afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with, but you did bang on a bit. Did I? Oh, yes. Well, what was all that for? asked the other girl, a shorter, round-faced girl who had been an art director for a small advertising company on Golgar Frinsham. Whatever the privations of this world were, she went to sleep every night profoundly grateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the morning it wouldn't be a hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste. For? For nothing. Nothing's for anything, said Ford Prefect happily. Come and join us. I'm Ford. This is Arthur. We were just about to do nothing at all for a while, but it can wait. The girls looked at them doubtfully. I'm Agda, said the tall one. This is Mella. Hello, Agda. Hello, Mella, said Ford. Do you talk at all? said Mella to Arthur. Oh, eventually, said Arthur, with a smile, but not as much as Ford. Good. There was a slight pause. What did you mean? asked Agda, about only having two million years. I couldn't make sense of what you were saying. Oh, that, said Ford. It doesn't matter. It's just that the world gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass, said Arthur with a shrug, but that's two million years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons do. Vogons? said Mella. Ah, yes. You wouldn't know them. Where did you get this idea from? It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the past or the future. Arthur smiled and looked away. Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense? asked Agda. Listen, forget it, said Ford. Forget all of it. Nothing matters. Look, it's a beautiful day. Enjoy it. The sun, the green of the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees. Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty horrible idea, said Mella. Destroying a world just to make a bypass! Oh, I've heard of worse, said Ford. I read of one planet, often the seventh dimension, that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic barbilliards, got potted straight into a black hole, killed ten billion people. That's mad, said Mella. Yes, and it scored thirty points, too. Agda and Mella exchanged glances. Look, said Agda, there's a party after the committee meeting tonight. You can come along if you like. Yeah, OK, said Ford. I'd like to, said Arthur. Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon rise over the dull red glow of the trees. That story about the world being destroyed, began Mella. In two million years, yes. You say it as if you really think it's true. Yes, I think it is. I think I was there. She shook her head in puzzlement. You're very strange, she said. No, I'm very ordinary, said Arthur. But some very strange things have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed from than differing. And that other world your friend talked about, the one that got pushed into a black hole? Ah, that I don't know about. Sounds like something from the book. What book? Arthur paused. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, he said at last. What's that? Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don't think I'll be wanting it any more, said Arthur Dent.
 Chapter 6. From here it was a four-mile walk to his village, a mile further to the turning, to which the abominable Russell had now fiercely declined to take him, and from there a further three miles of winding country lane. The Saab seethed off into the night. Arthur watched it go, as stunned as a man might be who, having believed himself to be totally blind for five years, suddenly discovers that he had merely been wearing too large a hat. He shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some salient fact which would fall into place and make some sense of an otherwise utterly bewildering universe. But since the salient fact, if there was one, entirely failed to do this, he set off up the road again, hoping that a good vigorous walk, and maybe even some good painful blisters, would help to reassure him of his own existence at least, if not his sanity. It was ten-thirty when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which there had hung for many years a battered old Guinness clock, which featured a picture of an emu, with a pint-glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat. This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunch-time, during which first his house, and then the entire planet earth, had been demolished—or rather had seemed to be demolished. No, damn it, had been demolished, because if it hadn't, then where the bloody heck had he been for the last eight years, and how had he got there if not in one of those big yellow Vogon ships which the appalling Russell had been telling him were merely drug-induced hallucinations, and yet if it had been demolished, what was he currently standing on? He jammed the brake on this line of thought, because it wasn't going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times he'd been over it. He started again. This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunch-time, during which whatever it was that had happened, that he was going to have to sort out later, had happened, and—it still didn't make sense. He started again. This was the pub in which—this was a pub. Pubs served drinks, and he couldn't half do with one. Satisfied that his jumbled thought-processes had at last arrived at a conclusion, and a conclusion he was happy with, even if it wasn't the one he had set out to achieve, he strode towards the door, and stopped. A small black wire-haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall, and then, catching sight of Arthur, began to snarl. Now, Arthur knew this dog, and he knew it well. It belonged to an advertising friend of his, and was called Know-Nothing Bozo, because the way its hair stood up on its head reminded people of the President of the United States of America. And the dog knew Arthur, or at least should do. It was a stupid dog, could not even read an autocue, which is why some people had protested about its name. But it should at least have been able to recognise Arthur, and instead of standing there, hackles raised, as if Arthur was the most fearful apparition ever to intrude upon its feeble-witted life. This prompted Arthur to go and peer at the window again, this time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu, but for himself. Seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context, he had to admit that the dog had a point. He looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds with, and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his present condition would excite comment of a raucous kind. And worse still, there would doubtless be several people in there at the moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound to bombard him with questions which at the moment he felt ill-equipped to deal with. Will Smithers, for instance, the owner of Know-Nothing Bozo, the non-wonder-dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from one of Will's own commercials for being incapable of knowing which dog food it was supposed to prefer, despite the fact that the meat in all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over it. Will would definitely be in there. Here was his dog, there was his car, a grey Porsche 928S, with a sign in the back window which read, My other car is also a Porsche. Damn him! He stared at it and realised that he had just learnt something he hadn't known before. Will Smithers, like most of the overpaid and underscrupulous bastards Arthur knew in advertising, made a point of changing his car every August, so that he could tell people his accountant made him do it, though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop him, what with all the alimony he had to pay, and so on. And this was the same car Arthur remembered him having before. The number plate proclaimed its year. Given that it was now winter and that the event which had caused Arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred at the beginning of September, less than six or seven months could have passed here. He stood terribly still for a moment, and let Know-Nothing Bozo jump up and down yapping at him. He was suddenly stunned by a realisation he could no longer avoid, which was this. He was now an alien on his own world. Try as they might, no one was even going to be able to believe his story. Not only did it sound perfectly potty, but it was flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts. Was this really the earth? Was there the slightest possibility that he had made some extraordinary mistake? The pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every detail—every brick, every piece of peeling paint—and inside he could sense its familiar stuffy, noisy warmth, its exposed beams, its unauthentic cast-iron light-fittings, its bar sticky with beer that people he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked by cardboard cut-outs of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts. It was all the stuff of his home, his world. He even knew this blasted dog. Hey! Know-Nothing! The sound of Will Smithers' voice meant he had to decide what to do quickly. If he stood his ground he would be discovered and the whole circus would begin. To hide would only postpone the moment, and it was bitterly cold now. The fact that it was Will made the choice easier. It wasn't that Arthur disliked him as such—Will was quite fun—it was just that he was fun in such an exhausting way, because being in advertising he always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and where he had got his jacket from. Mindful of this, Arthur hid behind a van. Hey! Know-Nothing! What's up? The door opened and Will came out, wearing a leather flying jacket that he had got a mate of his at the road research laboratory to crash a car into especially, in order to get that battered look. Know-Nothing yelped with delight, and having got the attention it wanted, was happy to forget Arthur. Will was with some friends, and they had a game they played with the dog. Commies! they all shouted at the dog in chorus. Commies! Commies! Commies! The dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping its little heart out beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage. They all laughed and cheered it on, then gradually dispersed to their various cars and disappeared into the night. Well that clears one thing up, thought Arthur from behind the van. This is quite definitely the planet I remember.
 Chapter VIII. In space travel, you see, said Slartibart fast as he fiddled with some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions—in space travel—he stopped and looked about him. The Room of Informational Illusions was a welcome relief after the visual monstrosities of the central computational area. There was nothing in it—no information, no illusions, just themselves, white walls, and a few small instruments which looked as if they were meant to plug into something which Slartibart fast couldn't find. Yes, urged Arthur. He had picked up Slartibart fast's sense of urgency, but didn't know what to do with it. Yes, what? said the old man. You were saying—Slartibart fast looked at him sharply. The numbers, he said, are awful. He resumed his search. Arthur nodded wisely to himself. After a while he realized that this wasn't getting him anywhere, and he decided that he would say, What, after all? In space travel, repeated Slartibart fast, all the numbers are awful. Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help, but Ford was practicing being sullen and getting quite good at it. I was only, said Slartibart fast to the side, trying to save you the trouble of asking me why all the ship's computations were being done on a waiter's billpad. Arthur frowned. Why, he said, were all the ship's computations being done on a wai— He stopped. Slartibart fast said, Because in space travel all the numbers are awful. He could tell that he wasn't getting his point across. Listen, he said, on a waiter's billpad numbers dance. You must have encountered the phenomenon. Well, on a waiter's billpad, said Slartibart fast, reality and unreality collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other, and anything is possible within certain parameters. What parameters? It's impossible to say, said Slartibart fast. That's one of them. Strange but true. At least I think it's strange, he added, and I am assured that it's true. At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had been searching, and clicked the instrument he was holding into it. Do not be alarmed, he said, and then suddenly darted an alarmed look at it himself, and lunged back. It's— They didn't hear what he said, because at that moment the ship winked out of existence around them, and a star battleship the size of a small Midlands industrial city plunged out of the sundered night towards them, star lasers ablaze. A nightmare storm of blistering light seared through the blackness and smacked a fair bit off the planet directly behind them. They gaped, pop-eyed, and were unable to scream.
 There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
 CHAPTER XII There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs near stations—a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special kind of pallor to the pork pies. Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches. There is a feeling which persists in England that making a sandwich interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat is something sinful that only foreigners do. Make them dry, is the instruction buried somewhere in the collective national consciousness. Make them rubbery. If you have to keep the buggers fresh, do it by washing them once a week. It is by eating sandwiches in pubs on Saturday lunchtimes that the British seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been. They are not altogether clear what those sins are, and don't want to know either. Sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about, but whatever sins there are, are amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat. If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the sausages which sit next to them, joyless tubes full of gristle, floating in a sea of something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chef's hat. A memorial, one feels, for some chef who hated the world, and died forgotten and alone among his cats in a back-stare in Stepney. The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are, and wish to atone for something specific. "'There must be somewhere better,' said Arthur. "'No time,' said Fenya, glancing at her watch. "'My train leaves in half an hour.' They sat at a small wobbly table. On it were some dirty glasses and some soggy beer-mats with jokes printed on them. Arthur got Fenya tomato juice and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it, and a couple of sausages. He didn't know why. He bought them for something to do while the gas settled in his glass. The barman dunked Arthur's change in a pool of beer on the bar, for which Arthur thanked him. "'All right,' said Fenya, glancing at her watch. "'Tell me what it is you have to tell me.' She sounded, as well she might, extremely sceptical, and Arthur's heart sank. Hardly he felt the most conducive setting to try to explain to her, as she sat there, suddenly cool and defensive, that in a sort of out-of-body dream he had had a telepathic sense that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the fact that, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass—something which he alone on earth knew anything about, having virtually witnessed it from a Vogon spaceship—and that furthermore both his body and soul ached for her unbearably, and he needed to go to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible. "'Fenny,' he started, "'I wonder if you'd like to buy some tickets for our raffle. It's just a little one.' He glanced up sharply. "'To raise money for Angie, who's retiring.' "'What?' "'And needs a kidney-machine.' He was being lent over by a rather stiffly slim middle-aged woman with a prim-knitted suit, a prim-little perm, and a prim-little smile that probably got licked by prim-little dogs a lot. She was holding out a small book of clercum tickets and a collecting tin. Only ten pence each, she said, so you could probably even buy two, without breaking the bank. She gave a tinkly little laugh, and then a curiously long sigh, saying, without breaking the bank, had obviously given her more pleasure than anything since some G.I.s had been billeted on her during the war. "'Yes, all right,' said Arthur, hurriedly digging in his pocket and producing a couple of coins. With infuriating slowness and prim theatricality, if there was such a thing, the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to Arthur. "'I do hope you win,' she said, with a smile that suddenly snapped together like a piece of advanced origami. The prizes are so nice.' "'Yes, thank you,' said Arthur, pocketing the tickets rather brusquely and glancing at his watch. He turned towards Fenny. So did the woman with the raffle-tickets. "'And what about you, young lady?' she said. "'It's for Angie's kidney-machine. She's retiring, you see.' "'Yes?' She hoisted the little smile even further up her face. She would have to stop and let it go soon, or the skin would surely split. "'Look, here you are,' said Arthur, and pushed a fifty-pence piece at her, in the hope that that would see her off. "'Oh, we ARE in the money, aren't we?' said the woman, with a long smiling sigh. "'Down from London, are we?' Arthur wished she wouldn't talk so bloody slowly. "'No, that's all right, really,' he said, with a wave of his hand, as she started with awful deliberation to peel off five tickets, one by one. "'Oh, but you MUST have our tickets,' insisted the woman, "'or you won't be able to claim your prize. They're very nice prizes, you know, very suitable.' Arthur snatched the tickets and said thank you as sharply as he could. The woman turned to Fenny once again. "'And now what about—' "'No!' Arthur nearly yelled. "'These are for her,' he explained, brandishing the five new tickets. "'Oh, I see. How nice!' She smiled sickeningly at both of them. "'Well, I do hope—' "'Yes!' snapped Arthur. "'Thank you.' The woman finally departed to the table next to theirs. Arthur turned desperately to Fenny, and was relieved to see that she was rocking with silent laughter. He smiled and sighed. "'Where were we?' he said. "'You were calling me Fenny, and I was about to ask you not to.' "'What do you mean?' She twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice. "'It's why I asked if you were a friend of my brother's—or half-brother, really. He's the only one who calls me Fenny, and I'm not fond of him for it. "'So what's—' "'Fennchurch.' "'What?' "'Fennchurch.' "'Fennchurch!' She looked at him sternly. "'Yes,' she said. "'And I'm watching you like a lynx to see if you're going to ask the same silly question that everyone asks me till I want to scream. I shall be cross and disappointed if you do. Plus I shall scream, so watch it.' She smiled, shook her hair a little forward over her face, and peered at him from behind it. "'Oh,' he said, "'that's a little unfair, isn't it?' "'Yes.' "'Fine. All right,' she said, with a laugh, "'you can ask me. Might as well get it over with. Better than have you calling me Fenny the whole time.' "'Presumably,' said Arthur. "'We've only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so generous when I spoke to you before—' "'What?' snapped Arthur. The woman with the perm and the smile, and the now nearly empty book of cloakroom tickets, and he was now waving the two last ones under his nose. "'I thought I'd give the opportunity to you because the prizes are so nice.' She wrinkled up her nose a little confidentially. "'Very tasteful. I know you like them. And it is for Angie's retirement present, you see. We want to give her—' "'A kidney-machine, yes,' said Arthur. "'Here.' He held out two more tenpence pieces to her and took the tickets. A thought seemed to strike the woman. It struck her very slowly. You could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach. "'Oh, dear,' she said, "'I'm not interrupting anything, am I?' She peered anxiously at both of them. "'No, it's fine,' said Arthur. "'Everything that could possibly be fine,' he insisted, 'is fine.' "'Thank you,' he added. "'I say,' she said, in a delighted ecstasy of worry, "'You're not in love, are you?' "'It's very hard to say,' said Arthur. "'We haven't had a chance to talk yet.' He glanced at Fenchurch. She was grinning. The woman nodded with knowing confidentiality. "'I'll let you see the prizes in a minute,' she said, and left. Arthur turned with a sigh back to the girl that he found it hard to say whether he was in love with. "'You were about to ask me,' she said, a question. "'Yes,' said Arthur. "'We can do it together, if you like,' said Fenchurch. Was I found—' "'In a handbag,' joined in Arthur. "'In the left luggage-office,' they said together, at Fenchurch Street Station. They finished. And the answer,' said Fenchurch, 'is no.' "'Fine,' said Arthur. "'I was conceived there.' "'What! I was—' "'In the left luggage-office!' hooted Arthur. "'No, of course not. Don't be silly. What would my parents be doing in the left luggage-office?' she said, rather taken aback by the suggestion. "'Well, I don't know,' spluttered Arthur. Or rather, it was in the ticket-queue. "'The—the ticket-queue! Or so they claim. They refuse to elaborate. They only say you wouldn't believe how bored it is possible to get in the ticket-queue at Fenchurch Street Station.' She sipped demurely at her tomato juice, and looked at her watch. Arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two. "'I'm going to have to go in a minute or two,' said Fenchurch. And you haven't begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary thing is that you're so keen to get off your chest.' "'Why don't you let me drive you to London?' said Arthur. "'It's Saturday. I've got nothing particular to do. I'd—' "'No,' said Fenchurch. "'Thank you. It's sweet of you. But no. I need to be by myself for a couple of days.' She smiled and shrugged. "'But—' "'You can tell me another time. I'll give you my number.' Arthur's heart went boom-boom, churn-churn, as she scribbled seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper, and handed it to him. "'Now we can relax,' she said, with a slow smile, which filled Arthur till he thought he would burst. "'Fenchurch,' he said, enjoying the name as he said it, "'I—a box—' said a trailing voice—'of cherry liqueurs, and also—and I know you will like this—a gramophone record of Scottish bagpipe music.' "'Yes, thank you. Very nice,' insisted Arthur. "'I just thought I'd let you have a look at them,' said the permed woman. "'I saw down from London—' She was holding them out proudly for Arthur to see. He could see that they were, indeed, a box of cherry-brandy liqueurs and a record of bagpipe music. That was what they were. "'I'll let you have your drink in peace now,' she said, patting Arthur lightly on his seething shoulder. "'But I knew you'd like to see—' Arthur re-engaged his eyes with Fenchurch's once again, and suddenly was at a loss for something to say. A moment had come and gone between the two of them, but the whole rhythm of it had been wrecked by that stupid, blasted woman. "'Don't worry,' said Fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over the top of her glass. "'We will talk again.' She took her sip. "'Perhaps,' she added, "'it wouldn't have gone so well if it wasn't for her.' She gave a wry smile, and dropped her hair forward over her face again. "'It was perfectly true. He had to admit it was perfectly true.'
 Chapter XXII Arthur woke and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he had had, but never anything on this scale. This was it. This was the big one. This was the ultimate pits. Matter-transference beams, he decided, were not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the head. Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull, stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought. The trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is basically one of them not being worth all the bother. On earth, when there had been an earth, before it was demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass, the problem had been with cars. The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to fill the air with, and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another, particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become as a result of this very similar to the place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke, and short of fish. And what about matter-transference beams? Any form of transport which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years, had to be bad news. Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent, and had even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation teleport systems factory on Happy World 3. All the barons great, okay, Algal's pretty neat, Beetlejuice's pretty girls will knock you off your feet, they'll do anything you like, real fast and then real slow, but if you have to take me apart to get me there then I don't want to go. Singing, take me apart, take me apart, what a way to roam, and if you have to take me apart to get me there I'd rather stay at home. Sirius is paved with gold, so I've heard it said, by nuts who then go on to say, see, tour before you're dead. I'll gladly take the high road or even take the low, but if you have to take me apart to get me there then I for one won't go. Singing, take me apart, take me apart, you must be off your head, and if you try to take me apart to get me there I'll stay right here in bed. And so on. Another favourite song was much shorter. I teleported home one night with Ron and Sid and Meg. Ron stole Meggie's heart away and I got Sidney's leg. Arthur felt waves of pain slowly receding, though he was still aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully he stood up. "'Can you hear a dull stomping throb?' said Ford Prefect. Arthur spun round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was approaching, looking red-eyed and pasty. "'Where are we?' gasped Arthur. Ford looked round. They were standing in a long curving corridor, which stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel wall, which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued, curved over the tops of their heads to where it met the inner perpendicular wall, which, oddly enough, was covered in dark brown Hessian wall-weave. The floor was of dark green ribbed rubber. Ford moved over to a very thick, dark transparent panel set in the outer wall. It was several layers deep, yet through it he could see pinpoints of distant stars. "'I think we're in a spaceship of some kind,' he said. Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb. "'Trillion?' called Arthur nervously. "'Zaphod?' Ford shrugged. "'Nowhere about,' he said. "'I've looked. They could be anywhere. An unprogrammed teleport can throw you light-years in any direction. Judging by the way I feel, I should think we have travelled a very long way indeed.' "'How do you feel?' "'Bad.' "'Do you think they're—' "'Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know, and no way we can do anything about it. Do what I do.' "'What?' "'Don't think about it.' Arthur turned his thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away. He took a deep breath. "'Footsteps!' exclaimed Arthur suddenly. "'Where?' "'That noise, that stomping throb, pounding feet. Listen!' Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from an indeterminate distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding footsteps, and it was noticeably louder. "'Let's move,' said Ford sharply. They both moved in opposite directions. "'Not that way,' said Ford. 'That's where they're coming from.' "'No, it's not,' said Arthur. 'They're coming from that way. They're not—' They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently. They both agreed with each other. They both set off in opposite directions again. Fear gripped them. From both directions the noise was getting louder. A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark, immensely long, and as they passed down it gave them the impression that they were getting colder and colder. The other corridors gave off it to the left and right, each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed. They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor they went the louder became the sound of pounding feet. They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened furiously. The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet were getting to them badly. Ford shivered, partly with the cold but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a beetle-jusian, ankle-high to an Arcturian mega-grasshopper. Stories of death-ships, haunted hulks that roamed restlessly around the obscure regions of deep space, infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews. Stories, too, of incautious travellers who found and entered such ships. Stories of— Then Ford remembered the brown Hessian wall-weave in the first corridor and pulled himself together. However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death-hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you liked that it wasn't with Hessian wall-weave. He grasped Arthur by the arm. Back the way he came, he said firmly, and they started to retrace their steps. A moment later they leaped like startled lizards down the nearest corridor junction, as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in front of them. Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in tracksuits, panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart-surgeon gibber. Ford Prefect stared after them. "'Joggers!' he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down the network of corridors. "'Joggers!' whispered Arthur Dent. "'Joggers,' said Ford Prefect with a shrug. The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It was very short and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined it, discovered the opening mechanism, and pushed it wide. The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin. The next 4,999 things that hit their eyes were also coffins.
 Chapter XXI. The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its fourth generation, and still no one shows any signs of leaving. Someone did once look at his watch, but that was eleven years ago now, and there has been no follow-up. The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but if you don't have any particular need to believe it, then don't go and look, because you won't enjoy it. There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the fleets of several rival carpet-cleaning companies who are hovering over the thing like vultures, but you shouldn't believe anything you hear at parties, and particularly not anything you hear at this one. One of the problems, and it's one that's obviously going to get worse, is that all the people at the party are either the children or the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren of the people who wouldn't leave in the first place, and because of all the business about selective breeding and recessive genes and so on, it means that all the people now at the party are either absolutely fanatical party-goers or gibbering idiots, or, more and more frequently, both. Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one. So, other factors come into operation, like when the drinks are going to run out. Now, because of certain things that have happened that seemed like a good idea at the time, and one of the problems of the party that never stops, is that all the things that only seemed like a good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas, that point seems still to be a long way off. One of the things that seemed like a good idea at the time was that the party should fly. Not in the normal sense that parties are meant to fly, but literally. One night, long ago, a band of drunken astro-engineers of the first generation clambered around the building digging this, fixing that, banging very hard on the other, and when the sun rose the following morning, it was startled to find itself shining on a building full of happy drunken people that was now floating like a young and uncertain bird over the treetops. Not only that, but the flying party had also managed to arm itself rather heavily. If they were going to get involved in any petty arguments with wine merchants, they wanted to make sure they had might on their side. The transition from full-time cocktail party to part-time raiding party came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest and swing to the whole affair that was badly needed at this point because of the enormous number of times that the band had already played all the numbers it knew over the years. They looted, they raided, they held whole cities to ransom for fresh supplies of cheese crackers, guacamole, spare ribs, and wine and spirits that would now get piped aboard from floating tankers. The problem of when the drinks are going to run out is, however, going to have to be faced one day. The planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet it was when they first started floating over it. It is in bad shape. The party has attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in which it lurches around the sky. It is one hell of a party. It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back.
 EPILOGUE. One of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who couldn't keep his mind on the job in hand. Brilliant, certainly. One of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other generation, including a number he had designed himself? Without a doubt. The problem was that he was far too interested in things which he shouldn't be interested in, at least, as people would tell him, not now. He was also, partly because of this, of a rather irritable disposition. So when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a distant star, who were still a fair way off but travelling fast, he, Blart Versenweld the Third, his name was Blart Versenweld the Third, which is not strictly relevant but quite interesting because, never mind, that was his name and we can talk about why it's interesting later, was sent into guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with instructions to design a breed of fanatical super warriors to resist and vanquish the feared invaders, do it quickly, and, they told him, concentrate. So he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and designed and designed and designed, but inevitably got a little distracted by things, and by the time the invaders were practically in orbit around them, had come up with a remarkable new breed of super-fly that could, unaided, figure out how to fly through the open half of a half-open window, and also an off-switch for children. Celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to be short-lived because disaster was imminent as the alien ships were landing. But astoundingly, the fearsome invaders, who, like most warlike races, were only on the rampage because they couldn't cope with things at home, were stunned by Versenweld's extraordinary breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations, and were instantly prevailed upon to sign a wide-ranging series of trading agreements and set up a programme of cultural exchanges, and, in an astonishing reversal of normal practice in the conduct of such matters, everybody concerned lived happily ever after. There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler's mind.
